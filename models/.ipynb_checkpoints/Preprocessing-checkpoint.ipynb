We are encouraged that\\r\\nhe intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the\\r\\nmandate for the work of the Organization during his\\r\\npresidency.\\r\\nI take this opportunity to sincerely compliment\\r\\nand to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign\\r\\nMinister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his\\r\\nguidance of the General Assembly in the past year,\\r\\nwhich included three special sessions and, of course,\\r\\nmeticulous preparations for and a successful\\r\\nconclusion to the Millennium Summit.\\r\\nI join India's voice to those of other delegations\\r\\nin noting with appreciation the dedication with which\\r\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United\\r\\nNations at a critical point.\\r\\nI am delighted on this occasion to warmly\\r\\nwelcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United\\r\\nNations.\\r\\nJust 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and\\r\\nGovernment assembled here for the Millennium\\r\\nSummit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as\\r\\nunique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium\\r\\nDeclaration that was then adopted encapsulates a\\r\\nshared vision that the international community work\\r\\ntogether in constructive cooperation to meet collective\\r\\nchallenges, within the framework of the United\\r\\nNations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister\\r\\nspoke, as did many others, of the need for the United\\r\\nNations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first\\r\\ncentury, to make it an effective instrument to translate\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\nour vision into reality. The United Nations is the house\\r\\nthat we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that\\r\\nit is equal to our collective expectations and our joint\\r\\naspirations.\\r\\nPeace, collective security and development\\r\\ninspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the\\r\\ntwenty-first century with extraordinary collective\\r\\nintellectual and technical capabilities. These are our\\r\\nglobal tools for overcoming the challenges before us.\\r\\nPeace and security for all is not just possible but is well\\r\\nwithin our grasp. Stability and development are the\\r\\nessential building blocks for the maintenance of peace\\r\\nand security. Threats to peace can and do arise from\\r\\ndifferent sources. It is not just weapons of mass\\r\\ndestruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but\\r\\nalso dehumanizing poverty and lack of development.\\r\\nWe must act as confident nation States committed\\r\\nto collective action and international cooperation, for\\r\\nthese are our means to provide wider effects of peace\\r\\nand progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect\\r\\nfor State sovereignty and non-interference in internal\\r\\naffairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must\\r\\nabjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances\\r\\nwarrant action by the Security Council, that action\\r\\nmust be firmly rooted in Charter provisions.\\r\\nThe Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of\\r\\nproposals. We recommend that the General Assembly\\r\\nexamine this important report carefully and take\\r\\nappropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United\\r\\nNations function of peacekeeping.\\r\\nWe support the Middle East peace process and\\r\\nfind the trend encouraging.\\r\\nThe historic summit between the Republic of\\r\\nKorea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\\r\\ntoo, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula.\\r\\nDisarmament — global nuclear disarmament in\\r\\nparticular — is essential to engender a greater sense of\\r\\nsecurity among Member States. India has been and will\\r\\ncontinue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global\\r\\nnuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation.\\r\\nWe welcome the recommendation of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral in his report to the Millennium Summit to\\r\\nconvene an international conference on eliminating\\r\\nnuclear danger. We urge commencement of\\r\\nnegotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring\\r\\nabout a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains\\r\\nready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps,\\r\\nsuch as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering\\r\\nnuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as\\r\\nwell as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non-\\r\\nuse of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon\\r\\nStates.\\r\\nThe situation with regard to the entry into force\\r\\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\\r\\n(CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of\\r\\nwork at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva\\r\\nshow the importance of building a consensus, both\\r\\nwithin and amongst nations, on issues that affect\\r\\nnational and international security. We are conscious\\r\\nthat 155 countries are at present signatories of the\\r\\nCTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing\\r\\ncommitment that India does not wish to stand in the\\r\\nway of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered\\r\\nto observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on\\r\\nfurther explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic\\r\\nobligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to\\r\\nengage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference\\r\\non Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban\\r\\nthe future production of fissile material for weapons\\r\\npurposes.\\r\\nThe illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of\\r\\nsmall arms, particularly by States to non-State actors\\r\\nand to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with\\r\\nterrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep\\r\\nconcern to the world community. When they are\\r\\ncombined with religious fanaticism and military\\r\\nadventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized\\r\\nnorms to which we strive to adhere. The international\\r\\ncommunity can no longer afford to permit these\\r\\npurveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue\\r\\nto inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look\\r\\nforward to a successful outcome of the United Nations\\r\\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\\r\\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year.\\r\\nTerrorism is the global menace of our age. For\\r\\nsome, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has\\r\\nbeen the object of State-sponsored, cross-border\\r\\nterrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more\\r\\nthan a decade. Even as the international community\\r\\nworks together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit\\r\\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we need to\\r\\ncontinually focus our attention on the users of such\\r\\nweapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on\\r\\nhuman decency, a violation of the basic precepts of\\r\\ndemocracy and the very antithesis of what the United\\r\\nNations represents and stands for. Because its principal\\r\\n18\\r\\n\\r\\ntargets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant\\r\\nviolation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime\\r\\nagainst humanity. It is also a threat to international\\r\\npeace and security, especially when terrorists are\\r\\narmed, financed and backed by Governments or their\\r\\nagencies.\\r\\nI urge all Members to work to strengthen the\\r\\ninternational consensus and legal regimes against\\r\\nterrorism. We have proposed the draft of a\\r\\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. I\\r\\nurge all Members of the United Nations to give their\\r\\ntotal support to this initiative.\\r\\nLet me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our\\r\\nchoice to accomplish our global agenda: the United\\r\\nNations. There is but one United Nations; none\\r\\nreplicate it, nor can any replace it.\\r\\nThe membership of the United Nations has\\r\\nincreased manifold in the last half century, and today\\r\\nstands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to\\r\\nhave the same basic structure as in the colonized world\\r\\nof 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of\\r\\nthe Security Council in both permanent and non-\\r\\npermanent categories is self-evident. The impact of\\r\\nactions of the Security Council is felt, with near total\\r\\nexclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have\\r\\nlittle influence in its decision-making. We have a\\r\\nglobal consensus that the form taken by the Security\\r\\nCouncil in the aftermath of the Second World War is\\r\\noutmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an\\r\\nenlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more\\r\\nthan 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need\\r\\nfor a Council reformed in its representation. An\\r\\nunrepresentative Security Council will lack the range\\r\\nand depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and\\r\\nunderstanding of the realities that it will have to deal\\r\\nwith or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm\\r\\nIndia's willingness to take on the responsibilities of\\r\\npermanent membership.\\r\\nThe General Assembly is the most important\\r\\norgan of the United Nations. It is here that all States,\\r\\nirrespective of considerations of strength, economy or\\r\\nsize, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic\\r\\nprinciple of sovereign equality. There is a growing\\r\\nfeeling among Member States that the functioning and\\r\\nrole of the General Assembly has to be made more\\r\\neffective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce\\r\\ndistance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together\\r\\ninto a new global neighbourhood as never before in\\r\\nhistory, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead\\r\\nus to increasing interdependence, our canvas of\\r\\ninternational cooperation and collective action has\\r\\nrapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more\\r\\ncomplex. The General Assembly has therefore to be\\r\\ncentral in accepting this new responsibility, this new\\r\\nchallenge.\\r\\nEven as we week to strengthen democratic\\r\\nprinciples and practices in the United Nations, and\\r\\neven as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside\\r\\ndictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have\\r\\nunfortunately witnessed some instances of regression\\r\\nas well. Such acts move against the currents of our\\r\\ntimes. The international community should oppose\\r\\nthese assaults on the spirit of our times and\\r\\nuncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic\\r\\nimpulses, practices and norms. It should show its\\r\\nsolidarity with the people of such countries. The\\r\\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\\r\\ndeserve our commendation for the steps they have\\r\\ntaken in this regard.\\r\\nDevelopments in Fiji since 19 May this year have\\r\\ncaused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken\\r\\nby the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the\\r\\nconstitutionally elected democratic Government there.\\r\\nWe hope that Fiji will return immediately to the\\r\\nconstitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law\\r\\nat the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial\\r\\ndiscrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest.\\r\\nWe hope that the international community will exercise\\r\\nits collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back\\r\\nto the road of democracy and the rule of law.\\r\\nIt appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten\\r\\nAfghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country\\r\\ncontinues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the\\r\\nmirage of military success. It also continues because of\\r\\noutside support, military and financial, to the Taliban.\\r\\nThis conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist\\r\\nideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the\\r\\nAfghan people. This adversely affects the peace and\\r\\nsecurity of the entire neighbourhood, from West to\\r\\nCentral Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate\\r\\nfrom the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in\\r\\nthe shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of\\r\\narms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The\\r\\nTaliban and their mentor must heed the world's\\r\\ndemands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for\\r\\na comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that\\r\\n19\\r\\n\\r\\nrestores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests\\r\\nand aspirations of all sections of that society.\\r\\nWe have consistently called upon the United\\r\\nNations to increase its development orientation and\\r\\nengagement, which is a core responsibility. We\\r\\nwelcome and support the declaration of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral last week to the United Nations Development\\r\\nProgramme's ministerial meeting that deficit in\\r\\ndevelopment will put in jeopardy all other goals of the\\r\\nUnited Nations. To address the root causes of poverty\\r\\nmeaningfully, we need firm international commitments\\r\\nto re-order and reshape international relations, in\\r\\nconsequence providing for equitable opportunities to\\r\\ndeveloping countries for resource earnings. Our call is\\r\\neven more relevant in today's fast integrating world.\\r\\nDeveloping countries and their people cannot\\r\\nthrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We\\r\\ntherefore hope that the forthcoming conference on\\r\\nfinancing for development would endorse concrete\\r\\ninitiatives for mobilization of the required external\\r\\nresources for development, whether from trade or\\r\\nconcessional flows, and treat this as a shared global\\r\\ngoal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the\\r\\ndifference that would be made if there was universal\\r\\nadherence to the agreed official development\\r\\nassistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross\\r\\nNational Product(GNP), within a specified time frame.\\r\\nNowhere is this more important than in the\\r\\ncontinent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be\\r\\nadequately supported by the international community.\\r\\nWe believe that issues relating to the development of\\r\\nAfrican countries must remain at the forefront of the\\r\\nwork of the General Assembly.\\r\\nThe process of globalization, with revolutionary\\r\\nleaps in communications and the great advance in\\r\\ninformation technology and increased mobility of\\r\\ncapital, trade and technology, has produced new\\r\\npotential for sustained economic growth. The benefits\\r\\nof globalization have, however, not percolated to the\\r\\nvast sections who live mired in poverty, without\\r\\nshelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has\\r\\noften been accompanied by enhanced poverty,\\r\\nunemployment and consequent social disintegration.\\r\\nThis poses a major challenge. We have to determine an\\r\\ninclusive concept of growth and development. We have\\r\\nto strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense,\\r\\nand not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While\\r\\nGDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to\\r\\ngrowth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and\\r\\nenhancement of the quality of life and creation of real\\r\\nchoices must be integral to the process of assessing the\\r\\nsuccess of development efforts.\\r\\nIn India, we have formulated development\\r\\nstrategies on the premise that economic and social\\r\\npolicies must subserve the primacy of the human being,\\r\\nand in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth\\r\\nalone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee\\r\\nsocial justice is crucial. Development based on uneven\\r\\nrewards will not be supported by those who are not its\\r\\nbeneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric.\\r\\nThe fullest possible participation of the people in the\\r\\ndevelopment process is the best guarantee for the\\r\\nsuccess of any growth strategy.\\r\\nMany challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to\\r\\nsustained economic growth for developing countries\\r\\nabound. Protectionist tendencies in developed\\r\\ncountries, a lack of political will to implement\\r\\ncommitments undertaken regarding development\\r\\nfinance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of\\r\\ndeveloping countries aggravate the situation. Special\\r\\nand differential treatment for developing countries\\r\\nguaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO)\\r\\nprovisions must be translated into operational reality.\\r\\nDeveloped countries should not seek to restrict market\\r\\naccess to goods and services and free movement of\\r\\nnatural persons, especially at a time when developing\\r\\ncountries are being asked to open up their economies\\r\\nand compete in the international economic domain.\\r\\nAnother challenge relates to reconciling the needs\\r\\nof economic and industrial growth with the need for\\r\\npreservation and protection of the environment. A safe\\r\\nand healthy environment for our peoples is an\\r\\nimperative. At the same time, all development cannot\\r\\nbe sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental\\r\\npreservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and\\r\\nenvironmental conservation cannot and should not\\r\\nimply maintenance of poverty.\\r\\nDeveloping countries have done commendable\\r\\nwork in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the\\r\\ncontext of an exceptionally difficult global\\r\\nenvironment. The promised resources from developed\\r\\ncountries have failed to materialize. The transfer of\\r\\ntechnologies on preferential and concessional terms has\\r\\nnot been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed\\r\\non technology transfer even on commercial terms. The\\r\\nspecial session of the United Nations General\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\nAssembly on the review and appraisal of the\\r\\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should\\r\\nconcentrate on finding solutions in addressing such\\r\\nunfulfilled commitments and providing reality and\\r\\noperational content to the declaration that “eradication\\r\\nof poverty is the over-riding priority of developing\\r\\ncountries”.\\r\\nChildren and issues relating to them are a priority.\\r\\nWe hope that the special session of the General\\r\\nAssembly next year will concentrate on the\\r\\nimplementation of the Declaration of the World\\r\\nSummit on Children.\\r\\nAdvancement of the democratic spirit and\\r\\novercoming challenges to it, growth with equity,\\r\\neconomic development with social justice and, as the\\r\\nprize that we seek, the creation of a world where\\r\\ninjustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and\\r\\nwelfare for all are among the goals that we should set\\r\\nfor ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The\\r\\nchallenge is nothing less than collective enlightened\\r\\nglobal ownership.\\r\\nThe General Assembly once again faces a heavy\\r\\nand challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let\\r\\nus wish ourselves success in our endeavours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>India congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the first General Assembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that he intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the mandate for the work of the Organization during his presidency. I take this opportunity to sincerely compliment and to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign Minister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his guidance of the General Assembly in the past year, which included three special sessions and, of course, meticulous preparations for and a successful conclusion to the Millennium Summit. I join India's voice to those of other delegations in noting with appreciation the dedication with which Secretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United Nations at a critical point. I am delighted on this occasion to warmly welcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United Nations. Just 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and Government assembled here for the Millennium Summit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as unique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium Declaration that was then adopted encapsulates a shared vision that the international community work together in constructive cooperation to meet collective challenges, within the framework of the United Nations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister spoke, as did many others, of the need for the United Nations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first century, to make it an effective instrument to translate 17  our vision into reality. The United Nations is the house that we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that it is equal to our collective expectations and our joint aspirations. Peace, collective security and development inspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the twenty-first century with extraordinary collective intellectual and technical capabilities. These are our global tools for overcoming the challenges before us. Peace and security for all is not just possible but is well within our grasp. Stability and development are the essential building blocks for the maintenance of peace and security. Threats to peace can and do arise from different sources. It is not just weapons of mass destruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but also dehumanizing poverty and lack of development. We must act as confident nation States committed to collective action and international cooperation, for these are our means to provide wider effects of peace and progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must abjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances warrant action by the Security Council, that action must be firmly rooted in Charter provisions. The Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of proposals. We recommend that the General Assembly examine this important report carefully and take appropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United Nations function of peacekeeping. We support the Middle East peace process and find the trend encouraging. The historic summit between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula. Disarmament — global nuclear disarmament in particular — is essential to engender a greater sense of security among Member States. India has been and will continue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global nuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation. We welcome the recommendation of the Secretary- General in his report to the Millennium Summit to convene an international conference on eliminating nuclear danger. We urge commencement of negotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring about a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains ready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps, such as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering nuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as well as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non- use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. The situation with regard to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of work at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva show the importance of building a consensus, both within and amongst nations, on issues that affect national and international security. We are conscious that 155 countries are at present signatories of the CTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing commitment that India does not wish to stand in the way of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered to observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on further explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic obligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban the future production of fissile material for weapons purposes. The illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of small arms, particularly by States to non-State actors and to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with terrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep concern to the world community. When they are combined with religious fanaticism and military adventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized norms to which we strive to adhere.

I urge all Members of the United Nations to give their total support to this initiative. Let me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our choice to accomplish our global agenda: the United Nations.

The need for expansion of the membership of the Security Council in both permanent and non- permanent categories is self-evident. The impact of actions of the Security Council is felt, with near total exclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have little influence in its decision-making. We have a global consensus that the form taken by the Security Council in the aftermath of the Second World War is outmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an enlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more than 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need for a Council reformed in its representation. An unrepresentative Security Council will lack the range and depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and understanding of the realities that it will have to deal with or the moral authority to take decisions.

It has also become vastly more complex. The General Assembly has therefore to be central in accepting this new responsibility, this new challenge. Even as we week to strengthen democratic principles and practices in the United Nations, and even as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have unfortunately witnessed some instances of regression as well. Such acts move against the currents of our times. The international community should oppose these assaults on the spirit of our times and uncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic impulses, practices and norms. It should show its solidarity with the people of such countries. The Organization of African Unity and the Commonwealth deserve our commendation for the steps they have taken in this regard. Developments in Fiji since 19 May this year have caused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken by the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the constitutionally elected democratic Government there. We hope that Fiji will return immediately to the constitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law at the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial discrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest. We hope that the international community will exercise its collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back to the road of democracy and the rule of law. It appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten Afghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country continues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the mirage of military success. It also continues because of outside support, military and financial, to the Taliban. This conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist ideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the Afghan people. This adversely affects the peace and security of the entire neighbourhood, from West to Central Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate from the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in the shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of arms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The Taliban and their mentor must heed the world's demands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for a comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that 19  restores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests and aspirations of all sections of that society. We have consistently called upon the United Nations to increase its development orientation and engagement, which is a core responsibility. We welcome and support the declaration of the Secretary- General last week to the United Nations Development Programme's ministerial meeting that deficit in development will put in jeopardy all other goals of the United Nations. To address the root causes of poverty meaningfully, we need firm international commitments to re-order and reshape international relations, in consequence providing for equitable opportunities to developing countries for resource earnings. Our call is even more relevant in today's fast integrating world. Developing countries and their people cannot thrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We therefore hope that the forthcoming conference on financing for development would endorse concrete initiatives for mobilization of the required external resources for development, whether from trade or concessional flows, and treat this as a shared global goal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the difference that would be made if there was universal adherence to the agreed official development assistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product(GNP), within a specified time frame. Nowhere is this more important than in the continent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be adequately supported by the international community. We believe that issues relating to the development of African countries must remain at the forefront of the work of the General Assembly. The process of globalization, with revolutionary leaps in communications and the great advance in information technology and increased mobility of capital, trade and technology, has produced new potential for sustained economic growth. The benefits of globalization have, however, not percolated to the vast sections who live mired in poverty, without shelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has often been accompanied by enhanced poverty, unemployment and consequent social disintegration. This poses a major challenge. We have to determine an inclusive concept of growth and development. We have to strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense, and not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While GDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to growth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and enhancement of the quality of life and creation of real choices must be integral to the process of assessing the success of development efforts. In India, we have formulated development strategies on the premise that economic and social policies must subserve the primacy of the human being, and in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth alone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee social justice is crucial. Development based on uneven rewards will not be supported by those who are not its beneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric. The fullest possible participation of the people in the development process is the best guarantee for the success of any growth strategy. Many challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to sustained economic growth for developing countries abound. Protectionist tendencies in developed countries, a lack of political will to implement commitments undertaken regarding development finance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of developing countries aggravate the situation. Special and differential treatment for developing countries guaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions must be translated into operational reality. Developed countries should not seek to restrict market access to goods and services and free movement of natural persons, especially at a time when developing countries are being asked to open up their economies and compete in the international economic domain. Another challenge relates to reconciling the needs of economic and industrial growth with the need for preservation and protection of the environment. A safe and healthy environment for our peoples is an imperative. At the same time, all development cannot be sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental preservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and environmental conservation cannot and should not imply maintenance of poverty. Developing countries have done commendable work in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the context of an exceptionally difficult global environment. The promised resources from developed countries have failed to materialize. The transfer of technologies on preferential and concessional terms has not been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed on technology transfer even on commercial terms. The special session of the United Nations General 20  Assembly on the review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should concentrate on finding solutions in addressing such unfulfilled commitments and providing reality and operational content to the declaration that “eradication of poverty is the over-riding priority of developing countries”. Children and issues relating to them are a priority. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly next year will concentrate on the implementation of the Declaration of the World Summit on Children. Advancement of the democratic spirit and overcoming challenges to it, growth with equity, economic development with social justice and, as the prize that we seek, the creation of a world where injustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and welfare for all are among the goals that we should set for ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The challenge is nothing less than collective enlightened global ownership. The General Assembly once again faces a heavy and challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let us wish ourselves success in our endeavours.</td>\n",
       "      <td>India congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the first General Assembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that he intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the mandate for the work of the Organization during his presidency. I take this opportunity to sincerely compliment and to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign Minister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his guidance of the General Assembly in the past year, which included three special sessions and, of course, meticulous preparations for and a successful conclusion to the Millennium Summit. I join India's voice to those of other delegations in noting with appreciation the dedication with which Secretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United Nations at a critical point. I am delighted on this occasion to warmly welcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United Nations. Just 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and Government assembled here for the Millennium Summit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as unique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium Declaration that was then adopted encapsulates a shared vision that the international community work together in constructive cooperation to meet collective challenges, within the framework of the United Nations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister spoke, as did many others, of the need for the United Nations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first century, to make it an effective instrument to translate 17  our vision into reality. The United Nations is the house that we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that it is equal to our collective expectations and our joint aspirations. Peace, collective security and development inspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the twenty-first century with extraordinary collective intellectual and technical capabilities. These are our global tools for overcoming the challenges before us. Peace and security for all is not just possible but is well within our grasp. Stability and development are the essential building blocks for the maintenance of peace and security. Threats to peace can and do arise from different sources. It is not just weapons of mass destruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but also dehumanizing poverty and lack of development. We must act as confident nation States committed to collective action and international cooperation, for these are our means to provide wider effects of peace and progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must abjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances warrant action by the Security Council, that action must be firmly rooted in Charter provisions. The Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of proposals. We recommend that the General Assembly examine this important report carefully and take appropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United Nations function of peacekeeping. We support the Middle East peace process and find the trend encouraging. The historic summit between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula. Disarmament — global nuclear disarmament in particular — is essential to engender a greater sense of security among Member States. India has been and will continue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global nuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation. We welcome the recommendation of the Secretary- General in his report to the Millennium Summit to convene an international conference on eliminating nuclear danger. We urge commencement of negotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring about a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains ready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps, such as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering nuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as well as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non- use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. The situation with regard to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of work at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva show the importance of building a consensus, both within and amongst nations, on issues that affect national and international security. We are conscious that 155 countries are at present signatories of the CTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing commitment that India does not wish to stand in the way of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered to observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on further explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic obligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban the future production of fissile material for weapons purposes. The illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of small arms, particularly by States to non-State actors and to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with terrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep concern to the world community. When they are combined with religious fanaticism and military adventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized norms to which we strive to adhere. The international community can no longer afford to permit these purveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue to inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look forward to a successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year. Terrorism is the global menace of our age. For some, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has been the object of State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more than a decade. Even as the international community works together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, we need to continually focus our attention on the users of such weapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on human decency, a violation of the basic precepts of democracy and the very antithesis of what the United Nations represents and stands for. Because its principal 18  targets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant violation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime against humanity. It is also a threat to international peace and security, especially when terrorists are armed, financed and backed by Governments or their agencies. I urge all Members to work to strengthen the international consensus and legal regimes against terrorism. We have proposed the draft of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. I urge all Members of the United Nations to give their total support to this initiative. Let me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our choice to accomplish our global agenda: the United Nations. There is but one United Nations; none replicate it, nor can any replace it. The membership of the United Nations has increased manifold in the last half century, and today stands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to have the same basic structure as in the colonized world of 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of the Security Council in both permanent and non- permanent categories is self-evident. The impact of actions of the Security Council is felt, with near total exclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have little influence in its decision-making. We have a global consensus that the form taken by the Security Council in the aftermath of the Second World War is outmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an enlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more than 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need for a Council reformed in its representation. An unrepresentative Security Council will lack the range and depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and understanding of the realities that it will have to deal with or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm India's willingness to take on the responsibilities of permanent membership. The General Assembly is the most important organ of the United Nations. It is here that all States, irrespective of considerations of strength, economy or size, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic principle of sovereign equality. There is a growing feeling among Member States that the functioning and role of the General Assembly has to be made more effective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce distance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together into a new global neighbourhood as never before in history, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead us to increasing interdependence, our canvas of international cooperation and collective action has rapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more complex. The General Assembly has therefore to be central in accepting this new responsibility, this new challenge. Even as we week to strengthen democratic principles and practices in the United Nations, and even as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have unfortunately witnessed some instances of regression as well. Such acts move against the currents of our times. The international community should oppose these assaults on the spirit of our times and uncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic impulses, practices and norms. It should show its solidarity with the people of such countries. The Organization of African Unity and the Commonwealth deserve our commendation for the steps they have taken in this regard. Developments in Fiji since 19 May this year have caused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken by the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the constitutionally elected democratic Government there. We hope that Fiji will return immediately to the constitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law at the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial discrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest. We hope that the international community will exercise its collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back to the road of democracy and the rule of law.

       "      <td>I take this opportunity to congratulate the\\r\\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election. I\\r\\nam confident that his vision and energy will guide this\\r\\nsession to a successful conclusion.\\r\\nI also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the\\r\\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with\\r\\ndistinction and efficiency.\\r\\nI commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed\\r\\nSecretary-General of this Organization, for the\\r\\nthoughtful recommendations which he has put forward\\r\\nin his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We\\r\\nthe peoples: the role of the United Nations in the\\r\\ntwenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have\\r\\nproved to be vital factors in advancing the work and\\r\\nmission of the United Nations at this critical time in the\\r\\nhistory of the Organization and the world.\\r\\nI join the previous speakers in welcoming the\\r\\nnation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of\\r\\nthe United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also\\r\\nthe smallest Member country of the Organization, with\\r\\na population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square\\r\\nmiles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the\\r\\nleader of that nation proudly take his place among the\\r\\nother leaders of the world in what was the largest\\r\\ngathering of heads of State or Government ever\\r\\nassembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There\\r\\nis a special affinity between the countries of the\\r\\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We\\r\\nare among the smallest constituents of the\\r\\nOrganization. We share similar historical and\\r\\nconstitutional experiences. We face the same\\r\\nenvironmental threats. We look forward, with\\r\\nconfidence, to a future involving the creative\\r\\n29\\r\\n\\r\\nutilization of the phenomenal developments in the area\\r\\nof information technology.\\r\\nMy country's Prime Minister, The Right\\r\\nHonourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders\\r\\nfrom the Caribbean Community, of which he is the\\r\\ncurrent Chairman, in denouncing the growing\\r\\ninsensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of\\r\\nsmall developing countries on the part of the powerful\\r\\nin today's world. In his address to the Millennium\\r\\nSummit the Prime Minister noted that while our\\r\\nreligious heritage has taught us how to reach across the\\r\\nboundaries of nations through the very inspirational\\r\\nguideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and\\r\\nvulnerable island States such as our own are being\\r\\nvictimized by the application of international rules\\r\\ncrafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes,\\r\\noblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the\\r\\nwell-being, of others. We are all affected by the\\r\\nmodalities of the global village which we inhabit,\\r\\nthrough revolutionary developments in communication\\r\\ntechnology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours,\\r\\nand yet the competition among the world's peoples has\\r\\nbecome fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead\\r\\nand widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is\\r\\nnow related not only to material wealth, but also,\\r\\nfrighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries\\r\\nto compete in the accepted medium of communication,\\r\\nbecause of the existence of an ever-widening digital\\r\\ndivide.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit concluded with the\\r\\nadoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming\\r\\nthe importance of the United Nations and the need to\\r\\nstrengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as\\r\\nmaking commitments to targeted reductions in poverty,\\r\\nthe levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by\\r\\nimpoverished nations around the world, the incidence\\r\\nand spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic\\r\\neducation for all children. On the other hand, we are\\r\\naware that the current world order is rapidly falling out\\r\\nof step with today's realities and that there is a pressing\\r\\nneed for the international community to come together\\r\\nand address the numerous challenges before us.\\r\\nWe must acknowledge that efforts to address old\\r\\nissues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well\\r\\nas new ones arising from globalization, the rapid\\r\\ngrowth of information technology and the resulting\\r\\ndigital divide, the consequences of the environmental\\r\\ndegradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender\\r\\nissues, among others, have largely been inadequate.\\r\\nOur common and daunting task is therefore to ensure\\r\\nthat this globalized world will be beneficial for all and\\r\\nnot just for some. More than ever before, there is an\\r\\nurgent need to foster a consciousness of universal\\r\\nmoral values in order to deal with present-day\\r\\nproblems, all of which are assuming an increasingly\\r\\nglobal dimension. The promotion of peace and human\\r\\nrights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and\\r\\namong States, the protection of immigrants, the\\r\\nsafeguarding of the environment, the battle against\\r\\nterrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms\\r\\ntrafficking, money laundering and economic and\\r\\npolitical corruption are issues which no nation,\\r\\nregardless of how wealthy or powerful, can\\r\\nsuccessfully address alone. They concern the entire\\r\\nhuman community and must be addressed and resolved\\r\\nthrough common universal efforts.\\r\\nMy country, a small State in the Caribbean, has\\r\\nalways been aware of its interdependence with other\\r\\ncountries for its prosperity and security. We have\\r\\nmoved to advance our interests through multilateral\\r\\ncooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\\r\\nStates (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of\\r\\nAmerican States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean\\r\\nStates (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions\\r\\nof the United Nations system. For a small developing\\r\\ncountry like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\\r\\nmultilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of\\r\\nour policies and programmes to enhance our standard\\r\\nof living and create a better life for all of our people. I\\r\\ntherefore reiterate my country's commitment to and\\r\\nsupport for the work of the United Nations and its\\r\\nagencies in this regard.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit provided an appropriate\\r\\nopportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate\\r\\nthemselves to the attempt to have an impact on and\\r\\nchange for the better the quality of life of the world's\\r\\npoorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of\\r\\ndeprivation and suffering. The Summit will have\\r\\nproved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new\\r\\nmillennium, but as an event that made the transition\\r\\nfrom words to deeds. The times demand nothing less.\\r\\nThe security, welfare and development of people\\r\\nmust, in the context of any new world order, dominate\\r\\nthe attention of the world's multilateral financial\\r\\ninstitutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must\\r\\nundertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our\\r\\npeople from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.\\r\\n30\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation\\r\\nprogrammes have been successful, much needs to be\\r\\ndone to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions\\r\\nstill suffer from hunger.\\r\\nWe had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera\\r\\nand tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and\\r\\ndrug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS\\r\\nare spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the\\r\\nCaribbean Community have placed combating this\\r\\npandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This\\r\\nscourge has already claimed the lives of over 10\\r\\nmillion people. It is projected to claim the lives of over\\r\\n200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in\\r\\nsub-Saharan Africa.\\r\\nThe developed world is not spared, either.\\r\\nWorldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are\\r\\nliving with the disease, over 18 million have died since\\r\\nthe beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million\\r\\nchildren have become orphaned. In the Caribbean\\r\\nregion, the disease now threatens the human resource\\r\\ndevelopment efforts of CARICOM and could reverse\\r\\nthe social and economic gains of the countries in that\\r\\nsubregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean\\r\\nis estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the\\r\\nhighest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second,\\r\\nin terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A\\r\\nUnited Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over\\r\\n360,000 adults and children in our region were living\\r\\nwith the disease. There is no immunity. International\\r\\ncooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields\\r\\nmust be intensified if the disease is to be contained.\\r\\nWe cannot preach about human rights and the\\r\\nuniversality of the United Nations while at the same\\r\\ntime ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people\\r\\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of\\r\\nthe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that\\r\\nthe time has come when serious consideration should\\r\\nbe given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on\\r\\nTaiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In\\r\\nthis regard, my Government is urging that the subject\\r\\nbe placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the\\r\\nGeneral Assembly. We urge every Member State of this\\r\\nnoble Organization to give its full support to this\\r\\nworthy initiative for a country whose democratic\\r\\ncredentials cannot be challenged.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\\r\\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process thus\\r\\nfar, and expresses the hope that through dialogue,\\r\\ncompromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace\\r\\nmay become a reality.\\r\\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\\r\\nare to survive globalization, the international\\r\\ncommunity must give careful and urgent consideration\\r\\nto the following measures: the revitalization of growth\\r\\nin developed countries; the lowering of interest rates;\\r\\naccess to the world's markets for the products of\\r\\ndeveloping countries; the reduction of debt and the\\r\\ndebt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating\\r\\nsituation in the marketing arrangements for primary\\r\\nproducts produced in the developing countries;\\r\\neconomic diversification; increasing the levels of\\r\\nofficial development assistance and humanitarian aid;\\r\\nreductions in net capital flows from bilateral and\\r\\nmultilateral sources; and combating the negative\\r\\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries like\\r\\nours, by international financial institutions, from\\r\\nconcessionary funding arrangements.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\\r\\nconcerns of other developing countries with regard to\\r\\nthe general decline in official development assistance\\r\\nand the flow of foreign direct investment to developing\\r\\ncountries. We look forward to the consultation on\\r\\nfinancing for development planned for 2001.\\r\\nThe changing world environment dictates the\\r\\nneed for the revitalization and restructuring of the\\r\\nvarious organs of the United Nations organizations, but\\r\\nmy Government attaches very high priority to the\\r\\nrevitalization and strengthening of the role of the\\r\\nUnited Nations in promoting international cooperation\\r\\nfor sound development, including economic\\r\\ndevelopment. We share the view that the United\\r\\nNations should be encouraged to develop its full\\r\\npotential in the area of international economic\\r\\ncooperation and should be endowed with the requisite\\r\\nresources to contribute to solving the serious economic\\r\\nand social problems facing developing countries in\\r\\ntheir efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nWe commend those donor countries that have\\r\\nmade financial contributions to the South Pacific\\r\\nApplied Geoscience Commission to assist the\\r\\ndevelopment of an environmental vulnerability index,\\r\\nand call for the early adoption by the international\\r\\ncommunity of a vulnerability index that would serve as\\r\\na guide for multilateral financial institutions and the\\r\\n31\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of\\r\\ndeveloping countries.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other\\r\\nsmall island developing States in the strategically\\r\\nlocated Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the\\r\\nendemic problems of the production, trafficking and\\r\\nconsumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic\\r\\nsubstances. This modern day scourge continues to pose\\r\\nserious problems which threaten to destroy the social\\r\\nand moral fabric of our communities. My Government\\r\\nis fully committed to the ongoing process of\\r\\ncooperation with other countries to counter these\\r\\nillegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in\\r\\nthis forum our complete support for the Multilateral\\r\\nEvaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the\\r\\nmember countries of the Organization of American\\r\\nStates (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the\\r\\ninternational fight against the drug trade. I also take\\r\\nthis opportunity to urge that more resources be\\r\\nallocated through collaborative efforts by the\\r\\ninternational community to encourage farmers to keep\\r\\naway from the production of illicit crops.\\r\\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\\r\\nChairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\\r\\nspoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good\\r\\ngovernance and respect for human rights and\\r\\ndemocracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are\\r\\naspects of our society of which we are eternally proud.\\r\\nRecently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our\\r\\nconstitutional democracy was put to the test through\\r\\nopen expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal\\r\\nthrough dialogue and compromise. My Government is\\r\\npleased to put on record its appreciation to the\\r\\nVincentian people for upholding democratic values and\\r\\nrespecting the supremacy of the constitution and the\\r\\nrule of law as fundamental principles by which our\\r\\nbeloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to\\r\\nexpress gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of\\r\\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to\\r\\nthe National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry\\r\\nand Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to\\r\\nmany individuals and other institutions for their\\r\\ninvaluable contributions in bringing about a swift\\r\\nresolution of the matter. My Government has long\\r\\nrecognized the urgent need for constitutional reform\\r\\nand will continue to work with other interested parties\\r\\nto bring about meaningful change that would seek,\\r\\namong other things, to strengthen the foundations of\\r\\nour democracy. As full members of this body, we have\\r\\nseen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional\\r\\nreform in the promotion of democracy, stability and\\r\\neconomic development.\\r\\nWe also recognize that constitutional reform is\\r\\ncrucial to strengthening our own integration processes\\r\\nwithin the Caribbean Community, including the\\r\\nestablishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be,\\r\\ninter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on\\r\\nmatters pertaining to the interpretation and\\r\\nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty of\\r\\nChaguaramas, which established CARICOM.\\r\\nMany matters of profound importance to Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean\\r\\nCommunity as a whole are included in the agenda of\\r\\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These\\r\\ninclude: sustainable development, the future of United\\r\\nNations reform, the International Criminal Court and\\r\\nhuman rights, the death penalty and financing for\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nI wish, once again, to focus the attention of this\\r\\nnoble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana\\r\\ntrade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well\\r\\ndocumented. Banana exports to the European Union\\r\\nfrom my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint\\r\\nLucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\\r\\ncountries are crucial to the economies of these\\r\\ncountries and represent over half of all export earnings\\r\\nin some cases. The industry provides substantial\\r\\nemployment for many families in Dominica, Saint\\r\\nLucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative\\r\\nof the efforts of the European Commission and other\\r\\nparties which seek to bring about an amicable and\\r\\nequitable solution to the dispute. However we are\\r\\ndeeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime\\r\\nbe eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with\\r\\nthe 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this\\r\\nwould have immeasurable harmful consequences for\\r\\nour economy. It will lead to the destruction of the\\r\\nCaribbean banana industry and negatively affect other\\r\\nACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to\\r\\nthe economy.\\r\\nThe two alternative solutions being proposed by\\r\\nthe European Commission, that is a first come, first\\r\\nserved system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that\\r\\nproves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only\\r\\nsystem, would prove to be disadvantageous and\\r\\n32\\r\\n\\r\\ndisastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system\\r\\nensures access.\\r\\nWe therefore urge the interested parties to the\\r\\ndispute to use their substantial influence to bring about\\r\\nthe much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a\\r\\nresolution that is acceptable to all parties. An\\r\\nefficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will\\r\\nsupport our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable\\r\\nisland State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining\\r\\npeace and economic security, which are vital for the\\r\\nachievement of economic diversification within a\\r\\nreasonable period of transition.\\r\\nWhile we recognize that there are structural and\\r\\ninherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to\\r\\ncompete with highly integrated operations on the\\r\\nmarket, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in\\r\\norder to allow our people to engage meaningfully in\\r\\ntrade and development, rather than be forever subjected\\r\\nto the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed\\r\\ndesire to hold on to our banana industry, which served\\r\\nus well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the\\r\\nrealities of the present day trade and economic\\r\\nenvironment.\\r\\nMy delegation also wishes to express its concern\\r\\nover the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within\\r\\nthe WTO that would prevent consideration of the\\r\\nwaiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU\\r\\nPartnership Agreement if it includes bananas without\\r\\nadvice on how the regime will be formed. My country\\r\\nand other members of the Caribbean Community have\\r\\nbeen actively engaged in diversifying our economies\\r\\nthroughout the last quarter of the last century. This has\\r\\ninvolved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing,\\r\\ntourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the\\r\\nGrenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have\\r\\nimproved air access to our country and my Government\\r\\ncontinues to prioritize the education of our people to\\r\\nprepare them for the opportunities that will accrue.\\r\\nMy Government will continue to honour its\\r\\ncommitments to all international agreements to which\\r\\nit is signatory. In furtherance to our international\\r\\nobligation we have signed the following: the United\\r\\nNations Convention on Contracts for the International\\r\\nSale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and\\r\\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United\\r\\nNations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea,\\r\\nthe International Convention Against the Taking of\\r\\nHostages and the Convention on the Prevention and\\r\\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\\r\\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these\\r\\ninstruments were deposited with the Secretary General\\r\\nduring the Millennium Summit.\\r\\nDuring his speech at the Millennium Summit,\\r\\nPrime Minister Mitchell stated that:\\r\\n“Small island States such as our own, with\\r\\nan enviable record of good governance and\\r\\nhuman rights, have seen the mighty in the banana\\r\\ntrade using the international rules — crafted by\\r\\nthem — impede our economic growth.”\\r\\nSimilarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by\\r\\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment (OECD) on our financial services,\\r\\nwithout any deference to our rights to be heard,\\r\\ndemonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small\\r\\nvulnerable States attempting to diversify their\\r\\neconomies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment,\\r\\n“Where is the fairness in free trade?”\\r\\nOffshore financial services is one of our chosen\\r\\navenues of economic diversification. We believe that\\r\\nwe are capable of offering a useful, professional and\\r\\nmutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly,\\r\\nin 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative\\r\\nexercise to ensure that we would put in place a\\r\\nregulatory and supervisory framework to adequately\\r\\nadminister the conduct of international financial\\r\\nbusinesses operating in Saint Vincent and the\\r\\nGrenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our\\r\\nregulatory regime against money laundering activities,\\r\\nwe enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being\\r\\na responsible member of the international community,\\r\\nincluding by playing its part in the war against money\\r\\nlaundering. We believe that those who toil to build a\\r\\nbetter life for themselves, their children, their\\r\\ngrandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be\\r\\nafforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such\\r\\npeople should have access to facilities that will\\r\\npreserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be\\r\\ncreated for them to optimize and maximize their\\r\\nwealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we\\r\\nbelieve in the preservation of privacy, we are also\\r\\nresolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable\\r\\ncharacter and conduct are not allowed to take\\r\\nadvantage of the opportunities that are available in our\\r\\ninternational finance sector.\\r\\n33\\r\\n\\r\\nMy country and others in the Caribbean\\r\\nCommunity are deeply concerned that the so-called\\r\\nharmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic\\r\\nCooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to\\r\\nfrustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the\\r\\nsovereignty of small island States desperately seeking\\r\\ncreative avenues for survival. Such action on the part\\r\\nof the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax\\r\\ncartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes\\r\\nfrom those who wish to legitimately escape them\\r\\nthrough the exercise of free choice. It would also close\\r\\noff an area of diversification and economic activity in\\r\\nwhich poor developing countries can be competitive\\r\\nand which they have actively promoted for a long time.\\r\\nThe unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial\\r\\nStability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force\\r\\nalso impact negatively on the burden of taxation in\\r\\nwealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of\\r\\nCaribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global\\r\\nfinancial service and stifle economic growth in the 47\\r\\nblacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils.\\r\\nThe small island States of the Caribbean are\\r\\namong those countries most at risk from the adverse\\r\\neffects of climate change. Already, many of our islands\\r\\nare experiencing those effects in areas that impact\\r\\ndirectly on the important tourism sector of our\\r\\neconomies. We are also prone to extremely damaging\\r\\nnatural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm\\r\\nsurges, which visit us annually with increasing\\r\\nfrequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also\\r\\nexperiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions\\r\\nand earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if\\r\\nless regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.\\r\\nThe continued committed support of the international\\r\\ncommunity is crucial in complementing the work of\\r\\nthose States in addressing these serious problems.\\r\\nOur survival as a region is intimately interwoven\\r\\nwith our environment. Our physical and economic\\r\\nlimitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways.\\r\\nSuch actions are a flagrant violation of our human\\r\\nrights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We\\r\\ntherefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a\\r\\nnuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nIn closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in\\r\\nthis forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of\\r\\nthe Charter of the United Nations, through service to\\r\\nour country, to the Caribbean and to the international\\r\\ncommunity. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of\\r\\nthe Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable\\r\\nSir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an\\r\\nelected member of our legislature. He has seen our\\r\\ncountry through the stages of constitutional\\r\\ndevelopment from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime\\r\\nMinister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to\\r\\ncontemplate public life without him. His address at the\\r\\nMillennium Summit was his last to this body, for he\\r\\nhas decided to demit office as Prime Minister before\\r\\nthe twenty-first anniversary of our political\\r\\nindependence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell\\r\\nhas made us all proud by his long, dedicated and\\r\\nvisionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the\\r\\narea of land reform, which empowered people through\\r\\nland ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate\\r\\nthat, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend\\r\\nsincere gratitude to him from this rostrum.\\r\\nThe challenge is ours: to turn our words into\\r\\naction and to agree on a common vision of our future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>I take this opportunity to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election. I am confident that his vision and energy will guide this session to a successful conclusion. I also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with distinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed Secretary-General of this Organization, for the thoughtful recommendations which he has put forward in his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have proved to be vital factors in advancing the work and mission of the United Nations at this critical time in the history of the Organization and the world. I join the previous speakers in welcoming the nation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of the United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also the smallest Member country of the Organization, with a population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square miles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the leader of that nation proudly take his place among the other leaders of the world in what was the largest gathering of heads of State or Government ever assembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There is a special affinity between the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We are among the smallest constituents of the Organization. We share similar historical and constitutional experiences. We face the same environmental threats. We look forward, with confidence, to a future involving the creative 29  utilization of the phenomenal developments in the area of information technology. My country's Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders from the Caribbean Community, of which he is the current Chairman, in denouncing the growing insensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of small developing countries on the part of the powerful in today's world. In his address to the Millennium Summit the Prime Minister noted that while our religious heritage has taught us how to reach across the boundaries of nations through the very inspirational guideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and vulnerable island States such as our own are being victimized by the application of international rules crafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes, oblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the well-being, of others. We are all affected by the modalities of the global village which we inhabit, through revolutionary developments in communication technology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours, and yet the competition among the world's peoples has become fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead and widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is now related not only to material wealth, but also, frighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries to compete in the accepted medium of communication, because of the existence of an ever-widening digital divide. The Millennium Summit concluded with the adoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming the importance of the United Nations and the need to strengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as making commitments to targeted reductions in poverty, the levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by impoverished nations around the world, the incidence and spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic education for all children. On the other hand, we are aware that the current world order is rapidly falling out of step with today's realities and that there is a pressing need for the international community to come together and address the numerous challenges before us. We must acknowledge that efforts to address old issues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well as new ones arising from globalization, the rapid growth of information technology and the resulting digital divide, the consequences of the environmental degradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender issues, among others, have largely been inadequate. Our common and daunting task is therefore to ensure that this globalized world will be beneficial for all and not just for some. More than ever before, there is an urgent need to foster a consciousness of universal moral values in order to deal with present-day problems, all of which are assuming an increasingly global dimension. The promotion of peace and human rights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and among States, the protection of immigrants, the safeguarding of the environment, the battle against terrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms trafficking, money laundering and economic and political corruption are issues which no nation, regardless of how wealthy or powerful, can successfully address alone. They concern the entire human community and must be addressed and resolved through common universal efforts. My country, a small State in the Caribbean, has always been aware of its interdependence with other countries for its prosperity and security. We have moved to advance our interests through multilateral cooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions of the United Nations system. For a small developing country like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, multilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of our policies and programmes to enhance our standard of living and create a better life for all of our people. I therefore reiterate my country's commitment to and support for the work of the United Nations and its agencies in this regard. The Millennium Summit provided an appropriate opportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate themselves to the attempt to have an impact on and change for the better the quality of life of the world's poorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of deprivation and suffering. The Summit will have proved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new millennium, but as an event that made the transition from words to deeds. The times demand nothing less. The security, welfare and development of people must, in the context of any new world order, dominate the attention of the world's multilateral financial institutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must undertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our people from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease. 30  While micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation programmes have been successful, much needs to be done to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions still suffer from hunger. We had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and drug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS are spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the Caribbean Community have placed combating this pandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This scourge has already claimed the lives of over 10 million people. It is projected to claim the lives of over 200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The developed world is not spared, either. Worldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are living with the disease, over 18 million have died since the beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million children have become orphaned. In the Caribbean region, the disease now threatens the human resource development efforts of CARICOM and could reverse the social and economic gains of the countries in that subregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean is estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the highest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second, in terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A United Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over 360,000 adults and children in our region were living with the disease. There is no immunity. International cooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields must be intensified if the disease is to be contained. We cannot preach about human rights and the universality of the United Nations while at the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that the time has come when serious consideration should be given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In this regard, my Government is urging that the subject be placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We urge every Member State of this noble Organization to give its full support to this worthy initiative for a country whose democratic credentials cannot be challenged. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the progress made in the Middle East peace process thus far, and expresses the hope that through dialogue, compromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace may become a reality. If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are to survive globalization, the international community must give careful and urgent consideration to the following measures: the revitalization of growth in developed countries; the lowering of interest rates; access to the world's markets for the products of developing countries; the reduction of debt and the debt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating situation in the marketing arrangements for primary products produced in the developing countries; economic diversification; increasing the levels of official development assistance and humanitarian aid; reductions in net capital flows from bilateral and multilateral sources; and combating the negative consequences of the graduation of some countries like ours, by international financial institutions, from concessionary funding arrangements. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the concerns of other developing countries with regard to the general decline in official development assistance and the flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries. We look forward to the consultation on financing for development planned for 2001. The changing world environment dictates the need for the revitalization and restructuring of the various organs of the United Nations organizations, but my Government attaches very high priority to the revitalization and strengthening of the role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for sound development, including economic development. We share the view that the United Nations should be encouraged to develop its full potential in the area of international economic cooperation and should be endowed with the requisite resources to contribute to solving the serious economic and social problems facing developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and development. We commend those donor countries that have made financial contributions to the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission to assist the development of an environmental vulnerability index, and call for the early adoption by the international community of a vulnerability index that would serve as a guide for multilateral financial institutions and the 31  United Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of developing countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other small island developing States in the strategically located Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the endemic problems of the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances. This modern day scourge continues to pose serious problems which threaten to destroy the social and moral fabric of our communities. My Government is fully committed to the ongoing process of cooperation with other countries to counter these illegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in this forum our complete support for the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the international fight against the drug trade. I also take this opportunity to urge that more resources be allocated through collaborative efforts by the international community to encourage farmers to keep away from the production of illicit crops. In his address to the Millennium Summit, the Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) spoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good governance and respect for human rights and democracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are aspects of our society of which we are eternally proud. Recently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our constitutional democracy was put to the test through open expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal through dialogue and compromise. My Government is pleased to put on record its appreciation to the Vincentian people for upholding democratic values and respecting the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law as fundamental principles by which our beloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to express gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to the National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to many individuals and other institutions for their invaluable contributions in bringing about a swift resolution of the matter. My Government has long recognized the urgent need for constitutional reform and will continue to work with other interested parties to bring about meaningful change that would seek, among other things, to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. As full members of this body, we have seen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional reform in the promotion of democracy, stability and economic development. We also recognize that constitutional reform is crucial to strengthening our own integration processes within the Caribbean Community, including the establishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be, inter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on matters pertaining to the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which established CARICOM. Many matters of profound importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean Community as a whole are included in the agenda of this fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These include: sustainable development, the future of United Nations reform, the International Criminal Court and human rights, the death penalty and financing for development. I wish, once again, to focus the attention of this noble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana trade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well documented. Banana exports to the European Union from my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint Lucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are crucial to the economies of these countries and represent over half of all export earnings in some cases. The industry provides substantial employment for many families in Dominica, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own country. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative of the efforts of the European Commission and other parties which seek to bring about an amicable and equitable solution to the dispute. However we are deeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime be eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this would have immeasurable harmful consequences for our economy. It will lead to the destruction of the Caribbean banana industry and negatively affect other ACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to the economy. The two alternative solutions being proposed by the European Commission, that is a first come, first served system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that proves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only system, would prove to be disadvantageous and 32  disastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system ensures access. We therefore urge the interested parties to the dispute to use their substantial influence to bring about the much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to all parties. An efficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will support our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable island State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining peace and economic security, which are vital for the achievement of economic diversification within a reasonable period of transition. While we recognize that there are structural and inherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to compete with highly integrated operations on the market, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in order to allow our people to engage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be forever subjected to the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry, which served us well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the realities of the present day trade and economic environment. My delegation also wishes to express its concern over the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within the WTO that would prevent consideration of the waiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement if it includes bananas without advice on how the regime will be formed. My country and other members of the Caribbean Community have been actively engaged in diversifying our economies throughout the last quarter of the last century. This has involved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing, tourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have improved air access to our country and my Government continues to prioritize the education of our people to prepare them for the opportunities that will accrue. My Government will continue to honour its commitments to all international agreements to which it is signatory. In furtherance to our international obligation we have signed the following: the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these instruments were deposited with the Secretary General during the Millennium Summit. During his speech at the Millennium Summit, Prime Minister Mitchell stated that: “Small island States such as our own, with an enviable record of good governance and human rights, have seen the mighty in the banana trade using the international rules — crafted by them — impede our economic growth.” Similarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on our financial services, without any deference to our rights to be heard, demonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small vulnerable States attempting to diversify their economies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment, “Where is the fairness in free trade?” Offshore financial services is one of our chosen avenues of economic diversification. We believe that we are capable of offering a useful, professional and mutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly, in 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative exercise to ensure that we would put in place a regulatory and supervisory framework to adequately administer the conduct of international financial businesses operating in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our regulatory regime against money laundering activities, we enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being a responsible member of the international community, including by playing its part in the war against money laundering. We believe that those who toil to build a better life for themselves, their children, their grandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be afforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such people should have access to facilities that will preserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be created for them to optimize and maximize their wealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we believe in the preservation of privacy, we are also resolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable character and conduct are not allowed to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in our international finance sector. 33  My country and others in the Caribbean Community are deeply concerned that the so-called harmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to frustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the sovereignty of small island States desperately seeking creative avenues for survival. Such action on the part of the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax cartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes from those who wish to legitimately escape them through the exercise of free choice. It would also close off an area of diversification and economic activity in which poor developing countries can be competitive and which they have actively promoted for a long time. The unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial Stability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force also impact negatively on the burden of taxation in wealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of Caribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global financial service and stifle economic growth in the 47 blacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils. The small island States of the Caribbean are among those countries most at risk from the adverse effects of climate change. Already, many of our islands are experiencing those effects in areas that impact directly on the important tourism sector of our economies. We are also prone to extremely damaging natural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm surges, which visit us annually with increasing frequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also experiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if less regularly than the pleasantly named perennials. The continued committed support of the international community is crucial in complementing the work of those States in addressing these serious problems. Our survival as a region is intimately interwoven with our environment. Our physical and economic limitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation of our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We therefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a nuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable development. In closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in this forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, through service to our country, to the Caribbean and to the international community. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of the Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an elected member of our legislature. He has seen our country through the stages of constitutional development from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime Minister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to contemplate public life without him. His address at the Millennium Summit was his last to this body, for he has decided to demit office as Prime Minister before the twenty-first anniversary of our political independence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell has made us all proud by his long, dedicated and visionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the area of land reform, which empowered people through land ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate that, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend sincere gratitude to him from this rostrum. The challenge is ours: to turn our words into action and to agree on a common vision of our future.</td>\n",

His vision and stewardship have proved to be vital factors in advancing the work and mission of the United Nations at this critical time in the history of the Organization and the world. I join the previous speakers in welcoming the nation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of the United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also the smallest Member country of the Organization, with a population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square miles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the leader of that nation proudly take his place among the other leaders of the world in what was the largest gathering of heads of State or Government ever assembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There is a special affinity between the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We are among the smallest constituents of the Organization. We share similar historical and constitutional experiences. We face the same environmental threats. We look forward, with confidence, to a future involving the creative 29  utilization of the phenomenal developments in the area of information technology. My country's Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders from the Caribbean Community, of which he is the current Chairman, in denouncing the growing insensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of small developing countries on the part of the powerful in today's world. In his address to the Millennium Summit the Prime Minister noted that while our religious heritage has taught us how to reach across the boundaries of nations through the very inspirational guideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and vulnerable island States such as our own are being victimized by the application of international rules crafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes, oblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the well-being, of others. We are all affected by the modalities of the global village which we inhabit, through revolutionary developments in communication technology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours, and yet the competition among the world's peoples has become fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead and widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is now related not only to material wealth, but also, frighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries to compete in the accepted medium of communication, because of the existence of an ever-widening digital divide. The Millennium Summit concluded with the adoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming the importance of the United Nations and the need to strengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as making commitments to targeted reductions in poverty, the levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by impoverished nations around the world, the incidence and spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic education for all children. On the other hand, we are aware that the current world order is rapidly falling out of step with today's realities and that there is a pressing need for the international community to come together and address the numerous challenges before us. We must acknowledge that efforts to address old issues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well as new ones arising from globalization, the rapid growth of information technology and the resulting digital divide, the consequences of the environmental degradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender issues, among others, have largely been inadequate. Our common and daunting task is therefore to ensure that this globalized world will be beneficial for all and not just for some. More than ever before, there is an urgent need to foster a consciousness of universal moral values in order to deal with present-day problems, all of which are assuming an increasingly global dimension. The promotion of peace and human rights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and among States, the protection of immigrants, the safeguarding of the environment, the battle against terrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms trafficking, money laundering and economic and political corruption are issues which no nation, regardless of how wealthy or powerful, can successfully address alone. They concern the entire human community and must be addressed and resolved through common universal efforts. My country, a small State in the Caribbean, has always been aware of its interdependence with other countries for its prosperity and security. We have moved to advance our interests through multilateral cooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions of the United Nations system. For a small developing country like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, multilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of our policies and programmes to enhance our standard of living and create a better life for all of our people. I therefore reiterate my country's commitment to and support for the work of the United Nations and its agencies in this regard. The Millennium Summit provided an appropriate opportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate themselves to the attempt to have an impact on and change for the better the quality of life of the world's poorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of deprivation and suffering. The Summit will have proved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new millennium, but as an event that made the transition from words to deeds. The times demand nothing less. The security, welfare and development of people must, in the context of any new world order, dominate the attention of the world's multilateral financial institutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must undertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our people from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease. 30  While micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation programmes have been successful, much needs to be done to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions still suffer from hunger. We had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and drug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS are spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the Caribbean Community have placed combating this pandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This scourge has already claimed the lives of over 10 million people. It is projected to claim the lives of over 200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The developed world is not spared, either. Worldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are living with the disease, over 18 million have died since the beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million children have become orphaned. In the Caribbean region, the disease now threatens the human resource development efforts of CARICOM and could reverse the social and economic gains of the countries in that subregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean is estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the highest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second, in terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A United Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over 360,000 adults and children in our region were living with the disease. There is no immunity. International cooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields must be intensified if the disease is to be contained. We cannot preach about human rights and the universality of the United Nations while at the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that the time has come when serious consideration should be given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In this regard, my Government is urging that the subject be placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We urge every Member State of this noble Organization to give its full support to this worthy initiative for a country whose democratic credentials cannot be challenged. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the progress made in the Middle East peace process thus far, and expresses the hope that through dialogue, compromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace may become a reality. If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are to survive globalization, the international community must give careful and urgent consideration to the following measures: the revitalization of growth in developed countries; the lowering of interest rates; access to the world's markets for the products of developing countries; the reduction of debt and the debt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating situation in the marketing arrangements for primary products produced in the developing countries; economic diversification; increasing the levels of official development assistance and humanitarian aid; reductions in net capital flows from bilateral and multilateral sources; and combating the negative consequences of the graduation of some countries like ours, by international financial institutions, from concessionary funding arrangements. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the concerns of other developing countries with regard to the general decline in official development assistance and the flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries. We look forward to the consultation on financing for development planned for 2001. The changing world environment dictates the need for the revitalization and restructuring of the various organs of the United Nations organizations, but my Government attaches very high priority to the revitalization and strengthening of the role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for sound development, including economic development. We share the view that the United Nations should be encouraged to develop its full potential in the area of international economic cooperation and should be endowed with the requisite resources to contribute to solving the serious economic and social problems facing developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and development. We commend those donor countries that have made financial contributions to the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission to assist the development of an environmental vulnerability index, and call for the early adoption by the international community of a vulnerability index that would serve as a guide for multilateral financial institutions and the 31  United Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of developing countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other small island developing States in the strategically located Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the endemic problems of the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances. This modern day scourge continues to pose serious problems which threaten to destroy the social and moral fabric of our communities. My Government is fully committed to the ongoing process of cooperation with other countries to counter these illegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in this forum our complete support for the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the international fight against the drug trade. I also take this opportunity to urge that more resources be allocated through collaborative efforts by the international community to encourage farmers to keep away from the production of illicit crops. In his address to the Millennium Summit, the Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) spoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good governance and respect for human rights and democracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are aspects of our society of which we are eternally proud. Recently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our constitutional democracy was put to the test through open expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal through dialogue and compromise. My Government is pleased to put on record its appreciation to the Vincentian people for upholding democratic values and respecting the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law as fundamental principles by which our beloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to express gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to the National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to many individuals and other institutions for their invaluable contributions in bringing about a swift resolution of the matter. My Government has long recognized the urgent need for constitutional reform and will continue to work with other interested parties to bring about meaningful change that would seek, among other things, to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. As full members of this body, we have seen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional reform in the promotion of democracy, stability and economic development. We also recognize that constitutional reform is crucial to strengthening our own integration processes within the Caribbean Community, including the establishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be, inter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on matters pertaining to the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which established CARICOM. Many matters of profound importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean Community as a whole are included in the agenda of this fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These include: sustainable development, the future of United Nations reform, the International Criminal Court and human rights, the death penalty and financing for development. I wish, once again, to focus the attention of this noble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana trade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well documented. Banana exports to the European Union from my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint Lucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are crucial to the economies of these countries and represent over half of all export earnings in some cases. The industry provides substantial employment for many families in Dominica, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own country. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative of the efforts of the European Commission and other parties which seek to bring about an amicable and equitable solution to the dispute. However we are deeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime be eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this would have immeasurable harmful consequences for our economy. It will lead to the destruction of the Caribbean banana industry and negatively affect other ACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to the economy. The two alternative solutions being proposed by the European Commission, that is a first come, first served system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that proves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only system, would prove to be disadvantageous and 32  disastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system ensures access. We therefore urge the interested parties to the dispute to use their substantial influence to bring about the much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to all parties. An efficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will support our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable island State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining peace and economic security, which are vital for the achievement of economic diversification within a reasonable period of transition. While we recognize that there are structural and inherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to compete with highly integrated operations on the market, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in order to allow our people to engage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be forever subjected to the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry, which served us well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the realities of the present day trade and economic environment. My delegation also wishes to express its concern over the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within the WTO that would prevent consideration of the waiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement if it includes bananas without advice on how the regime will be formed. My country and other members of the Caribbean Community have been actively engaged in diversifying our economies throughout the last quarter of the last century. This has involved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing, tourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have improved air access to our country and my Government continues to prioritize the education of our people to prepare them for the opportunities that will accrue. My Government will continue to honour its commitments to all international agreements to which it is signatory. In furtherance to our international obligation we have signed the following: the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these instruments were deposited with the Secretary General during the Millennium Summit. During his speech at the Millennium Summit, Prime Minister Mitchell stated that: “Small island States such as our own, with an enviable record of good governance and human rights, have seen the mighty in the banana trade using the international rules — crafted by them — impede our economic growth.” Similarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on our financial services, without any deference to our rights to be heard, demonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small vulnerable States attempting to diversify their economies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment, “Where is the fairness in free trade?” Offshore financial services is one of our chosen avenues of economic diversification. We believe that we are capable of offering a useful, professional and mutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly, in 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative exercise to ensure that we would put in place a regulatory and supervisory framework to adequately administer the conduct of international financial businesses operating in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our regulatory regime against money laundering activities, we enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being a responsible member of the international community, including by playing its part in the war against money laundering. We believe that those who toil to build a better life for themselves, their children, their grandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be afforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such people should have access to facilities that will preserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be created for them to optimize and maximize their wealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we believe in the preservation of privacy, we are also resolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable character and conduct are not allowed to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in our international finance sector. 33  My country and others in the Caribbean Community are deeply concerned that the so-called harmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to frustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the sovereignty of small island States desperately seeking creative avenues for survival. Such action on the part of the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax cartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes from those who wish to legitimately escape them through the exercise of free choice. It would also close off an area of diversification and economic activity in which poor developing countries can be competitive and which they have actively promoted for a long time. The unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial Stability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force also impact negatively on the burden of taxation in wealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of Caribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global financial service and stifle economic growth in the 47 blacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils. The small island States of the Caribbean are among those countries most at risk from the adverse effects of climate change. Already, many of our islands are experiencing those effects in areas that impact directly on the important tourism sector of our economies. We are also prone to extremely damaging natural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm surges, which visit us annually with increasing frequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also experiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if less regularly than the pleasantly named perennials. The continued committed support of the international community is crucial in complementing the work of those States in addressing these serious problems. Our survival as a region is intimately interwoven with our environment. Our physical and economic limitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation of our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We therefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a nuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable development. In closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in this forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, through service to our country, to the Caribbean and to the international community. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of the Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an elected member of our legislature. He has seen our country through the stages of constitutional development from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime Minister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to contemplate public life without him. His address at the Millennium Summit was his last to this body, for he has decided to demit office as Prime Minister before the twenty-first anniversary of our political independence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell has made us all proud by his long, dedicated and visionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the area of land reform, which empowered people through land ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate that, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend sincere gratitude to him from this rostrum. The challenge is ours: to turn our words into action and to agree on a common vision of our future.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I convey to the\\r\\nPresident the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his\\r\\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth\\r\\nsession of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him\\r\\nSri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work.\\r\\nTo the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo-\\r\\nBen Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and\\r\\nadmiration for the masterly manner in which he served\\r\\nas President of the fifty-fourth session of the General\\r\\nAssembly.\\r\\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\\r\\nwelcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United\\r\\nNations.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope\\r\\nthat its dreams and hopes for a better world will never\\r\\nfade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The\\r\\nPresident of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike\\r\\nKumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed,\\r\\n24\\r\\n\\r\\nthrough a message I had the honour to read out to the\\r\\nSummit, her hopes and her vision for the future of\\r\\nhumanity. Her words were these:\\r\\n“Peace among all States and peace among\\r\\nall peoples within States so that all, and not only\\r\\nsome, may in safety, without fear, in dignity,\\r\\nwithout humiliation, in good health, and in\\r\\nmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy the\\r\\nwonders of life on this miracle we call the planet\\r\\nEarth.” (A/55/PV.7)\\r\\nTherefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with\\r\\nemphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving,\\r\\nfor the future, those minimal and most fundamental\\r\\ncertainties that the Member States of the United\\r\\nNations have been able to establish — in particular, to\\r\\npreserve what was and continues to be the\\r\\nOrganization's very foundation: the entity we know as\\r\\nthe State. She pointed out that it was in the General\\r\\nAssembly that representatives of Governments, of\\r\\npeoples and of States gather together under a Charter\\r\\nthat assures States of their sovereign equality, their\\r\\npolitical independence and their territorial integrity.\\r\\nThese are the fundamentals of the United Nations\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\nAnd this is as it should be. States are the principal\\r\\norganizational entities into which the peoples of this\\r\\nplanet have gathered. The principal, overall\\r\\norganizational edifice of the international community is\\r\\nthe inter-States system.\\r\\nFor the entity we know as the State, there is no\\r\\nsubstitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization.\\r\\nIf States are diminished, so will this Organization be\\r\\ndiminished.\\r\\nThus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka\\r\\nthat everything possible be done to protect and\\r\\npreserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the\\r\\nstability and the well-being of the entity we know as\\r\\nthe State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity\\r\\nand political independence the Charter gave us its\\r\\nassurance.\\r\\nBefore proceeding any further I should make it\\r\\nclear — in view of recent statements on the part of\\r\\nspeakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with\\r\\nwhose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ —\\r\\nthat those who assert the necessity of continued\\r\\nreaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of\\r\\nthe Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not\\r\\nbe regarded — as having in any way diminished their\\r\\ncommitment to the importance of universal adherence\\r\\nto human rights and all that is required for the dignity\\r\\nof the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the\\r\\npromotion and protection of the human rights of its\\r\\nown people and of all peoples everywhere.\\r\\nThere is, however, a substantial body of opinion,\\r\\nwithin which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the\\r\\nview that the way to proceed in the matter of human\\r\\nrights and the dignity of the individual is properly\\r\\nthrough continued and close cooperation between all\\r\\nStates, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The\\r\\nway of multilateralism or globalization, which appear\\r\\nexpressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the\\r\\nsovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall,\\r\\na commendable course. It is not a course whose\\r\\nworthiness in practice has as yet been established.\\r\\nIndeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the\\r\\nsovereignty of States have often had disastrous\\r\\nconsequences. With that initial clarification and a\\r\\nreminder that human rights are for the observance not\\r\\nonly of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall\\r\\nproceed with the remainder of my address.\\r\\nWe must bear in mind that the entities we know\\r\\nas States are national and international corporate\\r\\nentities of enormous complexity, differing in so many\\r\\nrespects from corporate entities of the private sector\\r\\nand, of course, differing as well from those\\r\\ninnumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which\\r\\nwe refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat\\r\\nsimplistically, as civil society.\\r\\nIf the management of a developed State with\\r\\nmore than adequate resources at its command is a\\r\\ncomplex undertaking, how much more complex would\\r\\nbe the management of a developing State without such\\r\\nresources and such infrastructures? Then there are\\r\\nthose developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their\\r\\nmulti-ethnic, multireligious societies where the\\r\\nlegacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than\\r\\none generation to erase.\\r\\nAside from the pressures inherent in the very\\r\\nnature and history of a State, let us not forget the\\r\\nadditional external pressures a State is subject to —\\r\\neconomic, social and political, legitimate and\\r\\nillegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal —\\r\\nthat the age of information and its consequences have\\r\\nbrought in their wake. These are external pressures that\\r\\nraise troubling uncertainties for many States and for\\r\\n25\\r\\n\\r\\ndeveloping States in particular, that are without the\\r\\nblessings of abundant resources and advanced\\r\\ninfrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the\\r\\nstructures of States and could come close to threatening\\r\\ntheir very existence.\\r\\nWhere the processes of globalization are\\r\\nexploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the\\r\\nillegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the\\r\\nreport from the Secretariat received by this Assembly\\r\\nthree years ago which drew attention to the threat to\\r\\nGovernment authority and civil society, to law and\\r\\norder and to legitimate economic and political\\r\\ninstitutions posed by transnational networks of crime,\\r\\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism having\\r\\naccess to sophisticated information technologies and\\r\\nweaponry.\\r\\nOf course, where there is the use of internal\\r\\narmed force against a State, as in my country, the\\r\\ncomplexities within a State compound themselves\\r\\nmany times over; and we know that the use of armed\\r\\nforce against a State is the greatest threat of all to its\\r\\npreservation and well-being. This is particularly so in\\r\\ndemocracies, whose very openness makes them most\\r\\nvulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long-\\r\\nstanding and unwavering commitment to democratic\\r\\nfundamentals.\\r\\nPeace among States, the primary purpose of the\\r\\nCharter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in\\r\\nfact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of\\r\\ngenerally observed rules of international law, under and\\r\\npursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of\\r\\narmed force by one State against another State, except\\r\\nin self-defence or as authorized by the Security\\r\\nCouncil.\\r\\nYet when we turn to peace within States, and the\\r\\nuse of armed force against a State internally, we see an\\r\\nentirely different, and an often confusing and\\r\\nfrustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each\\r\\na creature of its own history; the nature of each\\r\\ndetermined by its own surroundings. There is no\\r\\nsimplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario,\\r\\nno easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in\\r\\nmany different forms.\\r\\nThe relatively clear-cut format of a United\\r\\nNations response to inter-State armed conflicts —\\r\\nmonitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an\\r\\nagreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal\\r\\narmed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable.\\r\\nThe Charter does not prescribe how this\\r\\nOrganization should proceed in cases of internal armed\\r\\nconflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2,\\r\\nparagraph 7, which says,\\r\\n“Nothing contained in the present Charter\\r\\nshall authorize the United Nations to intervene in\\r\\nmatters which are essentially within the domestic\\r\\njurisdiction of any State.”\\r\\nIn view of the varieties, complexities and\\r\\nintricacies of internal armed conflicts, this\\r\\nOrganization appears to be without the necessary\\r\\nstructure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and\\r\\nresources — and often, it would seem — without the\\r\\nnecessary collective will.\\r\\nTo suggest that the United Nations should\\r\\nintervene in internal armed conflicts across the\\r\\nboard — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of\\r\\nobvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local\\r\\ncircumstances — is wishful thinking of the most\\r\\nsimplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme.\\r\\nA proposition of such a nature ignores the\\r\\nfundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so\\r\\nimpressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of\\r\\nState of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his\\r\\nsummation of the deliberations of round table four: that\\r\\na democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental\\r\\nnecessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political\\r\\nprocesses, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the\\r\\ndemocratically expressed will of the populace of a\\r\\nState, which an armed terroristic attack on a\\r\\ndemocratic State so obviously constitutes.\\r\\nAt a more practical level, where would this\\r\\nOrganization — woefully under-financed for the\\r\\nfulfilment of its development objectives, which billions\\r\\naround this world expectantly await — obtain the\\r\\nfurther resources for such far-flung interventions in\\r\\ninternal domestic crises.\\r\\nCharter provisions and United Nations practice\\r\\naffirm that a State may act in individual or collective\\r\\nself-defence should there be an armed attack across its\\r\\nfrontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack,\\r\\nthe abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of\\r\\nmost developing States — to react with equivalent\\r\\narmed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the\\r\\nlaw of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order,\\r\\nare very limited. Traditional police services are\\r\\ninadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in\\r\\n26\\r\\n\\r\\nexperience. Few States have ready and affordable\\r\\naccess to the necessary information or intelligence.\\r\\nFew States are able to maintain military infrastructures\\r\\neffective against heavily armed guerrilla-type\\r\\nonslaughts and the horrors of terror.\\r\\nSuch has been the experience of my country. Sri\\r\\nLanka has for many years had within its territory an\\r\\narmed conflict that has complicated the lives of the\\r\\nentire population of the country. It is a conflict of an\\r\\nextraordinary nature. A very small group of armed\\r\\nfighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000\\r\\npersons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to\\r\\nviolence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society\\r\\nand participatory governance; achieving, through the\\r\\npractice of systematic terror, national and international\\r\\nnotoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such\\r\\nproblems as they may have through dialogue —\\r\\ncontinues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion\\r\\nagainst the State to fight for the establishment of a\\r\\nseparate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our\\r\\nterritory.\\r\\nA democratic State, because of its openness, its\\r\\nlaws, traditions and practices and its commitment to\\r\\ntolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the\\r\\ndeployment of force against it by any group within its\\r\\nboundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State\\r\\nanywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere.\\r\\nUnless all States, democratic States in particular, agree\\r\\nto come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy\\r\\nitself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will\\r\\nnot survive.\\r\\nWhen the security and integrity of one State is\\r\\nthreatened by an armed group within it, surely —\\r\\nespecially in these contemporary times, with the cold\\r\\nwar far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny\\r\\nthat armed group any encouragement, any succour, any\\r\\nsafe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist\\r\\nactivities in one country, massive funds are raised with\\r\\nimpunity in other countries, often through knowing or\\r\\nunknowing front organizations or other entities that\\r\\nnow proliferate in many forms and in many countries,\\r\\nand often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or\\r\\ngroups ostensibly concerned with human rights or\\r\\nethnic, cultural or social matters.\\r\\nThe magnitude of the collection of funds abroad\\r\\nfor terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the\\r\\nreach of the international networks developed for that\\r\\npurpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to\\r\\nexceed the receipts of many transnational\\r\\nconglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of\\r\\ncourse, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms\\r\\nor other merchandise, including the smuggling of\\r\\nhumans.\\r\\nBut there also exists a far more abundant and\\r\\nseemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely,\\r\\nexpatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the\\r\\nwestern media has reported over the past few years\\r\\nfrom time to time, collections from expatriates abroad\\r\\nfor the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which\\r\\nis battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering\\r\\nin their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month\\r\\nfrom one country; $600,000 a month from another;\\r\\n$2.7 million a month from yet another; and large\\r\\nadditional funds from expatriates in still other\\r\\ncountries.\\r\\nIn 1988 an excellent study was published on\\r\\nfinancial havens, banking secrecy and money\\r\\nlaundering, a study by experts in the field,\\r\\ncommissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug\\r\\nControl and Crime Prevention. In order to implement\\r\\nadequately the provisions of the recently adopted\\r\\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\\r\\nFinancing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by\\r\\nUnited Nations bodies on the collection of external\\r\\nfunds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion\\r\\nagainst a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes\\r\\nespecially necessary when the armed group battling a\\r\\nState is in blatant violation of the human rights and\\r\\nhumanitarian norms and standards — including those\\r\\nrelating to children and to children in armed conflict —\\r\\nthat this Organization so correctly and so diligently\\r\\nespouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in\\r\\nhuman society.\\r\\nI proposed such a study at the fourth round table\\r\\nof the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was\\r\\nendorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of\\r\\nAlgeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of\\r\\nthe proceedings of our round table. I urge that the\\r\\ninternational community give favourable consideration\\r\\nto that proposal.\\r\\nAs the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled\\r\\nby such massive funds from abroad continues within a\\r\\nState, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to\\r\\nblur, not only among those in civil society, who are\\r\\noften uninformed, but even on the part of those in\\r\\npositions of international authority, within and outside\\r\\n27\\r\\n\\r\\nthis Organization, who should know better. The\\r\\nexistence of the internal armed conflict and the\\r\\nresulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of\\r\\nhostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention\\r\\nto the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal\\r\\ngroup that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the\\r\\nvictim.\\r\\nSuch a blurring of international perceptions in\\r\\nsome quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is\\r\\ndistressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those,\\r\\nsuch as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and\\r\\ncontinue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic\\r\\nway of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic,\\r\\nmultireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we\\r\\nwere once so blessed to enjoy.\\r\\nI hope that the thoughts that I have expressed\\r\\ntoday on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the\\r\\naffairs of developing States in the main, will show in\\r\\nsome measure why a sympathetic, rather than an\\r\\ninquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the\\r\\naffairs of States, as in all human relationships.\\r\\nAt a more general level, I would like, before I\\r\\nmove on from this part of my statement, to refer to two\\r\\nother relevant questions: the role of the General\\r\\nAssembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of\\r\\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the only\\r\\nprincipal organ of the United Nations in which all\\r\\nMember States are represented, and the only principal\\r\\norgan whose terms of reference allow for consideration\\r\\nof any matter within the scope of the Charter.\\r\\nYet there is the perception among some that the\\r\\ncentre of gravity in decision-making on questions of\\r\\nmajor policy importance to the Organization appears to\\r\\nhave moved away from the General Assembly to an\\r\\nextent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly\\r\\nwelcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30\\r\\nof the Millennium Declaration of the central position of\\r\\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\\r\\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations,\\r\\nand the commitment of all nations to enable the\\r\\nGeneral Assembly to play that role effectively. The\\r\\npractical manner in which the General Assembly could\\r\\nplay that role will, of course, require very careful\\r\\nthought.\\r\\nThe ways in which “civil society”, and the\\r\\ninnumerable entities that that expression encompasses,\\r\\ncould best contribute to the work of the United\\r\\nNations — in terms of data collection, research and\\r\\nanalysis and expertise — in a manner that does not\\r\\nprejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United\\r\\nNations, will also require most careful examination.\\r\\nSuch contributions should be made in a manner that is\\r\\nnot partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but,\\r\\nrather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral\\r\\nconsultant.\\r\\nMoreover, although civil society within a national\\r\\ncontext could be, and is, well accommodated in\\r\\ndomestic political processes, the manner in which civil\\r\\nsociety could be internationally accommodated within\\r\\nUnited Nations processes still remains a puzzle.\\r\\nAs in all human relationships, so also amongst\\r\\nStates: the strong do better than the weak, the rich\\r\\nbetter than the poor, the developed better than the\\r\\ndeveloping. This is the case most of all when times are\\r\\nhard. The marked decline in official development\\r\\nassistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the\\r\\nrich and the developed to meet their official\\r\\ndevelopment assistance pledges, show that for States,\\r\\nthere is no general safety net.\\r\\nIf there is one message from the Millennium\\r\\nSummit, and one that is now coming from this\\r\\nMillennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that\\r\\nglobalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that\\r\\nno panacea for all — certainly not for the developing\\r\\nworld. The benefits of globalization have by-passed\\r\\nmuch of the developing world. The poorest among us,\\r\\nspanning the continents of Africa, Central America and\\r\\nAsia, have experienced increasing marginalization.\\r\\nThere is little opportunity for developing countries to\\r\\nbe formative in the shaping of the world economy for\\r\\nthe future — in the deliberations that really matter.\\r\\nThus, although we are leaving the past century\\r\\nand the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their\\r\\npassing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by\\r\\nthe old, intractable economic and social tragedies that\\r\\nhave been with us since the dawn of time: poverty,\\r\\nilliteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the\\r\\nproblems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and\\r\\nthe growth of mega-cities.\\r\\nAmong these, poverty alleviation and poverty\\r\\nelimination remain for most of us in the developing\\r\\nworld the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful\\r\\npriority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of\\r\\nabundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in\\r\\nreal time across billions of television screens\\r\\nthroughout the world, undermines the very foundations\\r\\n28\\r\\n\\r\\nnecessary for the growth of humane societies and\\r\\nrefined governance.\\r\\nThe developing world needs to be accorded an\\r\\nadequate formative voice in the formulation of a new\\r\\ndevelopment chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus\\r\\nwe turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse,\\r\\nas it were, to this General Assembly, under whose\\r\\nactive supervisory authority there must be a revival of\\r\\na comprehensive North-South development dialogue —\\r\\na dialogue that seems to be fading away.\\r\\nTo tell the countless starving and helpless\\r\\nmillions that a free global marketplace will show us the\\r\\nway is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough.\\r\\nResource deprivation over many generations and\\r\\nits debilitating consequences on adequate\\r\\ninfrastructural growth has severely damaged the\\r\\ncapacity of developing countries to cope with the\\r\\nmodern world.\\r\\nA new development chapter must provide for the\\r\\ncatastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man-\\r\\nmade” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the\\r\\npresent surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in\\r\\na decade that now place crushing burdens on the\\r\\nnational economies of developing countries struggling\\r\\ndesperately to contend with economic realities. They,\\r\\nlike Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil-\\r\\nproducing countries, which are certainly not insensitive\\r\\nto the plight of the developing world, will find it\\r\\npossible in some way to relieve such pressures in the\\r\\nvery near future.\\r\\nI should also wish at this juncture in my address\\r\\nto say a word about the South Asian Association for\\r\\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of\\r\\nSouth Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,\\r\\nNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is\\r\\ndeeply committed to the advancement of the economic\\r\\nand social well-being of our peoples, numbering now\\r\\nin the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through\\r\\nnational endeavour, but through regional and\\r\\ninternational cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current\\r\\nChair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the\\r\\nprogramme of activities laid down at the 1991\\r\\nColombo summit as best it can in difficult\\r\\ncircumstances. The people of our region are deeply\\r\\ncommitted to the goals of SAARC. They continue to\\r\\ninteract vigorously on a wide range of professional,\\r\\ncultural, educational and social activities,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level\\r\\npolitical involvement that SAARC has suffered at this\\r\\ntime. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be\\r\\nlong before our movement is again able to play its full\\r\\nrole in the welfare of our peoples.\\r\\nI have just returned to New York from the\\r\\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children,\\r\\norganized so successfully by the Government of\\r\\nCanada and held at Winnipeg.\\r\\nI cannot conclude my address to the General\\r\\nAssembly this year without making at least a brief\\r\\nreference to the abominable crimes that are being\\r\\ncommitted against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka\\r\\nby the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They\\r\\nhave been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year-\\r\\nold children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri\\r\\nLankan Army. Some of these children have been\\r\\nprogrammed into suicide bombers. They are forced to\\r\\nwear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on\\r\\nthem to evade capture. This wretched practice\\r\\ncontinues unabated.\\r\\nIn 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the\\r\\nSecretary-General's Special Representative for\\r\\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu,\\r\\nvisited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger\\r\\nleaders. They assured him that they would not recruit\\r\\nany person under the age of 17 and would not send into\\r\\nbattle any person below the age of 18. A few months\\r\\nago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have\\r\\nbeen continuous reports of the recruitment and the use\\r\\nof children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they\\r\\ngave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant\\r\\nanswer to a question by an interviewer, the Special\\r\\nRepresentative said this:\\r\\n“Children who become soldiers lose their\\r\\ninnocence. Part of the reason why the fighting\\r\\ngroups will tend to reach out to children is\\r\\nbecause, of course, the adults may become\\r\\ndisillusioned, they may be killed off, they may\\r\\nrun away, so they reach the children who are less\\r\\nable to defend themselves. But there's a more\\r\\ncynical reason than that: children, because they\\r\\nare innocent, can be moulded into the most\\r\\nunquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into\\r\\nsuicide commandos, into committing the worst\\r\\natrocities. In other situations, it is ideology —\\r\\ncome fight for the homeland, come fight for our\\r\\nethnic group, come fight for a new society — that\\r\\nmay appeal to families and to children. So there\\r\\n29\\r\\n\\r\\nare many reasons which facilitate the abuse of\\r\\nchildren in this way.”\\r\\nI thank the Special Representative for having had\\r\\nthe courage to speak out on this important issue. To\\r\\nremain silent in the face of such criminality is to\\r\\nencourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us\\r\\nwho care about the children of the world to rally\\r\\nagainst the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm\\r\\ncynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one\\r\\nthat abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the\\r\\nrepresentative of the United Nations Children's Fund in\\r\\nSri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his\\r\\nstatement — that the situation of children in the areas\\r\\nheld by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave\\r\\ntheir assurance to the United Nations Special\\r\\nRepresentative. Parents have reported that their\\r\\nchildren have been recruited. It is a serious problem.\\r\\nHe observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of\\r\\nTamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people\\r\\nthat they have taken measures to prevent children\\r\\nbelow 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take\\r\\ntheir promises seriously.\\r\\nA respected and courageous human rights group\\r\\nin Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who\\r\\nused to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent\\r\\nreport that since last May a fresh child-recruitment\\r\\ncampaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers.\\r\\nAccording to their report, children as young as 10 years\\r\\nare being forcibly conscripted, age being no\\r\\nconsideration as long as the child was able to carry a\\r\\ngun. In recent days and months the international press\\r\\nhas focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in\\r\\nSri Lanka.\\r\\nA few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its\\r\\ninstrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on\\r\\nthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the\\r\\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol\\r\\nhas noted that the Statute of the International Criminal\\r\\nCourt makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in\\r\\ncombat a war crime in both international and non-\\r\\ninternational armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors\\r\\nalso accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State\\r\\nparties to cooperate in preventing and combating such\\r\\ncrimes.\\r\\nAccordingly, today, in this General Assembly of\\r\\nthe United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to\\r\\nratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties\\r\\non whose territory the LTTE has offices and front\\r\\norganizations to take strong punitive action against\\r\\nsuch establishments, and to declare the LTTE a\\r\\ncriminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal\\r\\nactivity in respect of the use of child soldiers through\\r\\nfunds generated on the territories of other State parties,\\r\\nwhich are obliged to cooperate in terms of the\\r\\nConvention and the Protocol.\\r\\nThe Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with\\r\\nan impassioned plea to the world to move urgently\\r\\nfrom words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands\\r\\nof children who are abused, maimed, displaced,\\r\\ntraumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if\\r\\nanything should stir the conscience of mankind it is\\r\\nsurely the plight of these children. Let it not be said\\r\\nthat yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed\\r\\nthe anguished cry of children in distress, children on\\r\\nwhom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict,\\r\\nunspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on\\r\\nthe issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not\\r\\nrequired to save them. What is required is the will and\\r\\nthe commitment to act of those States which are in a\\r\\nposition to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to\\r\\nthem. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal\\r\\nnow so that when the special session of the General\\r\\nAssembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for\\r\\nChildren is held here in New York next September, we\\r\\nwill be able to adopt practical measures that will finally\\r\\nensure that children will be forever protected from the\\r\\nravages of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>I convey to the President the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his election to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him Sri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work. To the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo- Ben Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and admiration for the masterly manner in which he served as President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations. The Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope that its dreams and hopes for a better world will never fade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed, 24  through a message I had the honour to read out to the Summit, her hopes and her vision for the future of humanity. Her words were these: “Peace among all States and peace among all peoples within States so that all, and not only some, may in safety, without fear, in dignity, without humiliation, in good health, and in material and spiritual well-being enjoy the wonders of life on this miracle we call the planet Earth.” (A/55/PV.7) Therefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with emphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving, for the future, those minimal and most fundamental certainties that the Member States of the United Nations have been able to establish — in particular, to preserve what was and continues to be the Organization's very foundation: the entity we know as the State. She pointed out that it was in the General Assembly that representatives of Governments, of peoples and of States gather together under a Charter that assures States of their sovereign equality, their political independence and their territorial integrity. These are the fundamentals of the United Nations system. And this is as it should be. States are the principal organizational entities into which the peoples of this planet have gathered. The principal, overall organizational edifice of the international community is the inter-States system. For the entity we know as the State, there is no substitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization. If States are diminished, so will this Organization be diminished. Thus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka that everything possible be done to protect and preserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the stability and the well-being of the entity we know as the State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence the Charter gave us its assurance. Before proceeding any further I should make it clear — in view of recent statements on the part of speakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with whose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ — that those who assert the necessity of continued reaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of the Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not be regarded — as having in any way diminished their commitment to the importance of universal adherence to human rights and all that is required for the dignity of the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its own people and of all peoples everywhere. There is, however, a substantial body of opinion, within which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the view that the way to proceed in the matter of human rights and the dignity of the individual is properly through continued and close cooperation between all States, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The way of multilateralism or globalization, which appear expressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall, a commendable course. It is not a course whose worthiness in practice has as yet been established. Indeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States have often had disastrous consequences. With that initial clarification and a reminder that human rights are for the observance not only of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall proceed with the remainder of my address. We must bear in mind that the entities we know as States are national and international corporate entities of enormous complexity, differing in so many respects from corporate entities of the private sector and, of course, differing as well from those innumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which we refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat simplistically, as civil society. If the management of a developed State with more than adequate resources at its command is a complex undertaking, how much more complex would be the management of a developing State without such resources and such infrastructures? Then there are those developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their multi-ethnic, multireligious societies where the legacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than one generation to erase. Aside from the pressures inherent in the very nature and history of a State, let us not forget the additional external pressures a State is subject to — economic, social and political, legitimate and illegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal — that the age of information and its consequences have brought in their wake. These are external pressures that raise troubling uncertainties for many States and for 25  developing States in particular, that are without the blessings of abundant resources and advanced infrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the structures of States and could come close to threatening their very existence. Where the processes of globalization are exploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the illegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the report from the Secretariat received by this Assembly three years ago which drew attention to the threat to Government authority and civil society, to law and order and to legitimate economic and political institutions posed by transnational networks of crime, narcotics, money laundering and terrorism having access to sophisticated information technologies and weaponry. Of course, where there is the use of internal armed force against a State, as in my country, the complexities within a State compound themselves many times over; and we know that the use of armed force against a State is the greatest threat of all to its preservation and well-being. This is particularly so in democracies, whose very openness makes them most vulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long- standing and unwavering commitment to democratic fundamentals. Peace among States, the primary purpose of the Charter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in fact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of generally observed rules of international law, under and pursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of armed force by one State against another State, except in self-defence or as authorized by the Security Council. Yet when we turn to peace within States, and the use of armed force against a State internally, we see an entirely different, and an often confusing and frustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each a creature of its own history; the nature of each determined by its own surroundings. There is no simplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario, no easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in many different forms. The relatively clear-cut format of a United Nations response to inter-State armed conflicts — monitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an agreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal armed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable. The Charter does not prescribe how this Organization should proceed in cases of internal armed conflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2, paragraph 7, which says, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.” In view of the varieties, complexities and intricacies of internal armed conflicts, this Organization appears to be without the necessary structure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and resources — and often, it would seem — without the necessary collective will. To suggest that the United Nations should intervene in internal armed conflicts across the board — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of obvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local circumstances — is wishful thinking of the most simplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme. A proposition of such a nature ignores the fundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so impressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of State of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his summation of the deliberations of round table four: that a democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental necessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political processes, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the democratically expressed will of the populace of a State, which an armed terroristic attack on a democratic State so obviously constitutes. At a more practical level, where would this Organization — woefully under-financed for the fulfilment of its development objectives, which billions around this world expectantly await — obtain the further resources for such far-flung interventions in internal domestic crises. Charter provisions and United Nations practice affirm that a State may act in individual or collective self-defence should there be an armed attack across its frontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack, the abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of most developing States — to react with equivalent armed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the law of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order, are very limited. Traditional police services are inadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in 26  experience. Few States have ready and affordable access to the necessary information or intelligence. Few States are able to maintain military infrastructures effective against heavily armed guerrilla-type onslaughts and the horrors of terror. Such has been the experience of my country. Sri Lanka has for many years had within its territory an armed conflict that has complicated the lives of the entire population of the country. It is a conflict of an extraordinary nature. A very small group of armed fighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000 persons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to violence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society and participatory governance; achieving, through the practice of systematic terror, national and international notoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such problems as they may have through dialogue — continues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion against the State to fight for the establishment of a separate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our territory. A democratic State, because of its openness, its laws, traditions and practices and its commitment to tolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the deployment of force against it by any group within its boundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State anywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere. Unless all States, democratic States in particular, agree to come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy itself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will not survive. When the security and integrity of one State is threatened by an armed group within it, surely — especially in these contemporary times, with the cold war far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny that armed group any encouragement, any succour, any safe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist activities in one country, massive funds are raised with impunity in other countries, often through knowing or unknowing front organizations or other entities that now proliferate in many forms and in many countries, and often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or groups ostensibly concerned with human rights or ethnic, cultural or social matters. The magnitude of the collection of funds abroad for terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the reach of the international networks developed for that purpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to exceed the receipts of many transnational conglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of course, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms or other merchandise, including the smuggling of humans. But there also exists a far more abundant and seemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely, expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the western media has reported over the past few years from time to time, collections from expatriates abroad for the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which is battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering in their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month from one country; $600,000 a month from another; $2.7 million a month from yet another; and large additional funds from expatriates in still other countries. In 1988 an excellent study was published on financial havens, banking secrecy and money laundering, a study by experts in the field, commissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. In order to implement adequately the provisions of the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by United Nations bodies on the collection of external funds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion against a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes especially necessary when the armed group battling a State is in blatant violation of the human rights and humanitarian norms and standards — including those relating to children and to children in armed conflict — that this Organization so correctly and so diligently espouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in human society. I proposed such a study at the fourth round table of the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was endorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of Algeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of the proceedings of our round table. I urge that the international community give favourable consideration to that proposal. As the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled by such massive funds from abroad continues within a State, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to blur, not only among those in civil society, who are often uninformed, but even on the part of those in positions of international authority, within and outside 27  this Organization, who should know better. The existence of the internal armed conflict and the resulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of hostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention to the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal group that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the victim. Such a blurring of international perceptions in some quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is distressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those, such as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and continue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic way of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic, multireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we were once so blessed to enjoy. I hope that the thoughts that I have expressed today on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the affairs of developing States in the main, will show in some measure why a sympathetic, rather than an inquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the affairs of States, as in all human relationships. At a more general level, I would like, before I move on from this part of my statement, to refer to two other relevant questions: the role of the General Assembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of the United Nations. The General Assembly is the only principal organ of the United Nations in which all Member States are represented, and the only principal organ whose terms of reference allow for consideration of any matter within the scope of the Charter. Yet there is the perception among some that the centre of gravity in decision-making on questions of major policy importance to the Organization appears to have moved away from the General Assembly to an extent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly welcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30 of the Millennium Declaration of the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy- making and representative organ of the United Nations, and the commitment of all nations to enable the General Assembly to play that role effectively. The practical manner in which the General Assembly could play that role will, of course, require very careful thought. The ways in which “civil society”, and the innumerable entities that that expression encompasses, could best contribute to the work of the United Nations — in terms of data collection, research and analysis and expertise — in a manner that does not prejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United Nations, will also require most careful examination. Such contributions should be made in a manner that is not partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but, rather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral consultant. Moreover, although civil society within a national context could be, and is, well accommodated in domestic political processes, the manner in which civil society could be internationally accommodated within United Nations processes still remains a puzzle. As in all human relationships, so also amongst States: the strong do better than the weak, the rich better than the poor, the developed better than the developing. This is the case most of all when times are hard. The marked decline in official development assistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the rich and the developed to meet their official development assistance pledges, show that for States, there is no general safety net. If there is one message from the Millennium Summit, and one that is now coming from this Millennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that globalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that no panacea for all — certainly not for the developing world. The benefits of globalization have by-passed much of the developing world. The poorest among us, spanning the continents of Africa, Central America and Asia, have experienced increasing marginalization. There is little opportunity for developing countries to be formative in the shaping of the world economy for the future — in the deliberations that really matter. Thus, although we are leaving the past century and the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their passing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by the old, intractable economic and social tragedies that have been with us since the dawn of time: poverty, illiteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the problems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and the growth of mega-cities. Among these, poverty alleviation and poverty elimination remain for most of us in the developing world the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful priority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of abundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in real time across billions of television screens throughout the world, undermines the very foundations 28  necessary for the growth of humane societies and refined governance. The developing world needs to be accorded an adequate formative voice in the formulation of a new development chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus we turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse, as it were, to this General Assembly, under whose active supervisory authority there must be a revival of a comprehensive North-South development dialogue — a dialogue that seems to be fading away. To tell the countless starving and helpless millions that a free global marketplace will show us the way is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough. Resource deprivation over many generations and its debilitating consequences on adequate infrastructural growth has severely damaged the capacity of developing countries to cope with the modern world. A new development chapter must provide for the catastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man- made” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the present surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in a decade that now place crushing burdens on the national economies of developing countries struggling desperately to contend with economic realities. They, like Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil- producing countries, which are certainly not insensitive to the plight of the developing world, will find it possible in some way to relieve such pressures in the very near future. I should also wish at this juncture in my address to say a word about the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of South Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is deeply committed to the advancement of the economic and social well-being of our peoples, numbering now in the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through national endeavour, but through regional and international cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current Chair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the programme of activities laid down at the 1991 Colombo summit as best it can in difficult circumstances. The people of our region are deeply committed to the goals of SAARC. They continue to interact vigorously on a wide range of professional, cultural, educational and social activities, notwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level political involvement that SAARC has suffered at this time. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be long before our movement is again able to play its full role in the welfare of our peoples. I have just returned to New York from the International Conference on War-Affected Children, organized so successfully by the Government of Canada and held at Winnipeg. I cannot conclude my address to the General Assembly this year without making at least a brief reference to the abominable crimes that are being committed against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka by the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They have been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year- old children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri Lankan Army. Some of these children have been programmed into suicide bombers. They are forced to wear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on them to evade capture. This wretched practice continues unabated. In 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, visited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger leaders. They assured him that they would not recruit any person under the age of 17 and would not send into battle any person below the age of 18. A few months ago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have been continuous reports of the recruitment and the use of children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they gave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant answer to a question by an interviewer, the Special Representative said this: “Children who become soldiers lose their innocence. Part of the reason why the fighting groups will tend to reach out to children is because, of course, the adults may become disillusioned, they may be killed off, they may run away, so they reach the children who are less able to defend themselves. But there's a more cynical reason than that: children, because they are innocent, can be moulded into the most unquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into suicide commandos, into committing the worst atrocities. In other situations, it is ideology — come fight for the homeland, come fight for our ethnic group, come fight for a new society — that may appeal to families and to children. So there 29  are many reasons which facilitate the abuse of children in this way.” I thank the Special Representative for having had the courage to speak out on this important issue. To remain silent in the face of such criminality is to encourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us who care about the children of the world to rally against the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm cynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one that abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the representative of the United Nations Children's Fund in Sri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his statement — that the situation of children in the areas held by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave their assurance to the United Nations Special Representative. Parents have reported that their children have been recruited. It is a serious problem. He observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people that they have taken measures to prevent children below 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take their promises seriously. A respected and courageous human rights group in Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who used to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent report that since last May a fresh child-recruitment campaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers. According to their report, children as young as 10 years are being forcibly conscripted, age being no consideration as long as the child was able to carry a gun. In recent days and months the international press has focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in Sri Lanka. A few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol has noted that the Statute of the International Criminal Court makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in combat a war crime in both international and non- international armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors also accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State parties to cooperate in preventing and combating such crimes. Accordingly, today, in this General Assembly of the United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to ratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties on whose territory the LTTE has offices and front organizations to take strong punitive action against such establishments, and to declare the LTTE a criminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal activity in respect of the use of child soldiers through funds generated on the territories of other State parties, which are obliged to cooperate in terms of the Convention and the Protocol. The Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with an impassioned plea to the world to move urgently from words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands of children who are abused, maimed, displaced, traumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if anything should stir the conscience of mankind it is surely the plight of these children. Let it not be said that yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed the anguished cry of children in distress, children on whom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict, unspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on the issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not required to save them. What is required is the will and the commitment to act of those States which are in a position to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to them. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal now so that when the special session of the General Assembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for Children is held here in New York next September, we will be able to adopt practical measures that will finally ensure that children will be forever protected from the ravages of war.</td>\n",
       "      <td>I convey to the President the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his election to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him Sri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work. To the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo- Ben Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and admiration for the masterly manner in which he served as President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations. The Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope that its dreams and hopes for a better world will never fade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed, 24  through a message I had the honour to read out to the Summit, her hopes and her vision for the future of humanity. Her words were these: “Peace among all States and peace among all peoples within States so that all, and not only some, may in safety, without fear, in dignity, without humiliation, in good health, and in material and spiritual well-being enjoy the wonders of life on this miracle we call the planet Earth.” (A/55/PV.7) Therefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with emphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving, for the future, those minimal and most fundamental certainties that the Member States of the United Nations have been able to establish — in particular, to preserve what was and continues to be the Organization's very foundation: the entity we know as the State. She pointed out that it was in the General Assembly that representatives of Governments, of peoples and of States gather together under a Charter that assures States of their sovereign equality, their political independence and their territorial integrity. These are the fundamentals of the United Nations system. And this is as it should be. States are the principal organizational entities into which the peoples of this planet have gathered. The principal, overall organizational edifice of the international community is the inter-States system. For the entity we know as the State, there is no substitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization. If States are diminished, so will this Organization be diminished. Thus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka that everything possible be done to protect and preserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the stability and the well-being of the entity we know as the State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence the Charter gave us its assurance. Before proceeding any further I should make it clear — in view of recent statements on the part of speakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with whose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ — that those who assert the necessity of continued reaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of the Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not be regarded — as having in any way diminished their commitment to the importance of universal adherence to human rights and all that is required for the dignity of the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its own people and of all peoples everywhere. There is, however, a substantial body of opinion, within which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the view that the way to proceed in the matter of human rights and the dignity of the individual is properly through continued and close cooperation between all States, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The way of multilateralism or globalization, which appear expressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall, a commendable course. It is not a course whose worthiness in practice has as yet been established. Indeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States have often had disastrous consequences. With that initial clarification and a reminder that human rights are for the observance not only of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall proceed with the remainder of my address. We must bear in mind that the entities we know as States are national and international corporate entities of enormous complexity, differing in so many respects from corporate entities of the private sector and, of course, differing as well from those innumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which we refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat simplistically, as civil society. If the management of a developed State with more than adequate resources at its command is a complex undertaking, how much more complex would be the management of a developing State without such resources and such infrastructures? Then there are those developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their multi-ethnic, multireligious societies where the legacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than one generation to erase. Aside from the pressures inherent in the very nature and history of a State, let us not forget the additional external pressures a State is subject to — economic, social and political, legitimate and illegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal — that the age of information and its consequences have brought in their wake. These are external pressures that raise troubling uncertainties for many States and for 25  developing States in particular, that are without the blessings of abundant resources and advanced infrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the structures of States and could come close to threatening their very existence. Where the processes of globalization are exploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the illegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the report from the Secretariat received by this Assembly three years ago which drew attention to the threat to Government authority and civil society, to law and order and to legitimate economic and political institutions posed by transnational networks of crime, narcotics, money laundering and terrorism having access to sophisticated information technologies and weaponry. Of course, where there is the use of internal armed force against a State, as in my country, the complexities within a State compound themselves many times over; and we know that the use of armed force against a State is the greatest threat of all to its preservation and well-being. This is particularly so in democracies, whose very openness makes them most vulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long- standing and unwavering commitment to democratic fundamentals. Peace among States, the primary purpose of the Charter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in fact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of generally observed rules of international law, under and pursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of armed force by one State against another State, except in self-defence or as authorized by the Security Council. Yet when we turn to peace within States, and the use of armed force against a State internally, we see an entirely different, and an often confusing and frustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each a creature of its own history; the nature of each determined by its own surroundings. There is no simplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario, no easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in many different forms. The relatively clear-cut format of a United Nations response to inter-State armed conflicts — monitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an agreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal armed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable. The Charter does not prescribe how this Organization should proceed in cases of internal armed conflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2, paragraph 7, which says, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.” In view of the varieties, complexities and intricacies of internal armed conflicts, this Organization appears to be without the necessary structure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and resources — and often, it would seem — without the necessary collective will. To suggest that the United Nations should intervene in internal armed conflicts across the board — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of obvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local circumstances — is wishful thinking of the most simplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme. A proposition of such a nature ignores the fundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so impressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of State of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his summation of the deliberations of round table four: that a democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental necessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political processes, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the democratically expressed will of the populace of a State, which an armed terroristic attack on a democratic State so obviously constitutes. At a more practical level, where would this Organization — woefully under-financed for the fulfilment of its development objectives, which billions around this world expectantly await — obtain the further resources for such far-flung interventions in internal domestic crises. Charter provisions and United Nations practice affirm that a State may act in individual or collective self-defence should there be an armed attack across its frontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack, the abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of most developing States — to react with equivalent armed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the law of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order, are very limited. Traditional police services are inadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in 26  experience. Few States have ready and affordable access to the necessary information or intelligence. Few States are able to maintain military infrastructures effective against heavily armed guerrilla-type onslaughts and the horrors of terror. Such has been the experience of my country. Sri Lanka has for many years had within its territory an armed conflict that has complicated the lives of the entire population of the country. It is a conflict of an extraordinary nature. A very small group of armed fighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000 persons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to violence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society and participatory governance; achieving, through the practice of systematic terror, national and international notoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such problems as they may have through dialogue — continues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion against the State to fight for the establishment of a separate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our territory. A democratic State, because of its openness, its laws, traditions and practices and its commitment to tolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the deployment of force against it by any group within its boundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State anywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere. Unless all States, democratic States in particular, agree to come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy itself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will not survive. When the security and integrity of one State is threatened by an armed group within it, surely — especially in these contemporary times, with the cold war far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny that armed group any encouragement, any succour, any safe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist activities in one country, massive funds are raised with impunity in other countries, often through knowing or unknowing front organizations or other entities that now proliferate in many forms and in many countries, and often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or groups ostensibly concerned with human rights or ethnic, cultural or social matters. The magnitude of the collection of funds abroad for terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the reach of the international networks developed for that purpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to exceed the receipts of many transnational conglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of course, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms or other merchandise, including the smuggling of humans. But there also exists a far more abundant and seemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely, expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the western media has reported over the past few years from time to time, collections from expatriates abroad for the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which is battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering in their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month from one country; $600,000 a month from another; $2.7 million a month from yet another; and large additional funds from expatriates in still other countries. In 1988 an excellent study was published on financial havens, banking secrecy and money laundering, a study by experts in the field, commissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. In order to implement adequately the provisions of the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by United Nations bodies on the collection of external funds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion against a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes especially necessary when the armed group battling a State is in blatant violation of the human rights and humanitarian norms and standards — including those relating to children and to children in armed conflict — that this Organization so correctly and so diligently espouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in human society. I proposed such a study at the fourth round table of the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was endorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of Algeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of the proceedings of our round table. I urge that the international community give favourable consideration to that proposal. As the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled by such massive funds from abroad continues within a State, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to blur, not only among those in civil society, who are often uninformed, but even on the part of those in positions of international authority, within and outside 27  this Organization, who should know better. The existence of the internal armed conflict and the resulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of hostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention to the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal group that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the victim. Such a blurring of international perceptions in some quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is distressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those, such as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and continue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic way of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic, multireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we were once so blessed to enjoy. I hope that the thoughts that I have expressed today on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the affairs of developing States in the main, will show in some measure why a sympathetic, rather than an inquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the affairs of States, as in all human relationships. At a more general level, I would like, before I move on from this part of my statement, to refer to two other relevant questions: the role of the General Assembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of the United Nations. The General Assembly is the only principal organ of the United Nations in which all Member States are represented, and the only principal organ whose terms of reference allow for consideration of any matter within the scope of the Charter. Yet there is the perception among some that the centre of gravity in decision-making on questions of major policy importance to the Organization appears to have moved away from the General Assembly to an extent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly welcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30 of the Millennium Declaration of the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy- making and representative organ of the United Nations, and the commitment of all nations to enable the General Assembly to play that role effectively. The practical manner in which the General Assembly could play that role will, of course, require very careful thought. The ways in which “civil society”, and the innumerable entities that that expression encompasses, could best contribute to the work of the United Nations — in terms of data collection, research and analysis and expertise — in a manner that does not prejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United Nations, will also require most careful examination. Such contributions should be made in a manner that is not partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but, rather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral consultant. Moreover, although civil society within a national context could be, and is, well accommodated in domestic political processes, the manner in which civil society could be internationally accommodated within United Nations processes still remains a puzzle. As in all human relationships, so also amongst States: the strong do better than the weak, the rich better than the poor, the developed better than the developing. This is the case most of all when times are hard. The marked decline in official development assistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the rich and the developed to meet their official development assistance pledges, show that for States, there is no general safety net. If there is one message from the Millennium Summit, and one that is now coming from this Millennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that globalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that no panacea for all — certainly not for the developing world. The benefits of globalization have by-passed much of the developing world. The poorest among us, spanning the continents of Africa, Central America and Asia, have experienced increasing marginalization. There is little opportunity for developing countries to be formative in the shaping of the world economy for the future — in the deliberations that really matter. Thus, although we are leaving the past century and the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their passing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by the old, intractable economic and social tragedies that have been with us since the dawn of time: poverty, illiteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the problems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and the growth of mega-cities. Among these, poverty alleviation and poverty elimination remain for most of us in the developing world the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful priority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of abundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in real time across billions of television screens throughout the world, undermines the very foundations 28  necessary for the growth of humane societies and refined governance.

It has done so in the Balkans by providing\\r\\nmedical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of\\r\\nlaw, the media and women's rights. We have noted with\\r\\ninterest the recommendations made in the Brahimi\\r\\nreport concerning the non-military aspects of peace\\r\\noperations. We will be studying them carefully now\\r\\nthat we are in the process of looking into how we can\\r\\nstrengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the\\r\\nfuture.\\r\\nThe report states that expressions of general\\r\\nsupport in the form of statements and resolutions must\\r\\nbe followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking\\r\\nthese words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making.\\r\\nIn the preparations for the Millennium Assembly,\\r\\nthe Secretary-General encouraged Member States to\\r\\nengage more effectively in the international legal\\r\\nframework by acceding to a number of legal\\r\\ninstruments. One to which Iceland has decided to\\r\\naccede is the Convention on the Safety of United\\r\\nNations and Associated Personnel.\\r\\nThe Security Council has the primary\\r\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\\r\\npeace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded\\r\\nin reflecting the tremendous changes in the\\r\\ninternational arena which have taken place since its\\r\\nestablishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years\\r\\nto come, the reform process has to be accelerated.\\r\\nThe rules of international law governing the\\r\\nrelations between States are now well established; this\\r\\nalso applies in the fields of human rights and\\r\\nhumanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and\\r\\nobligations of States and individuals. But ground rules\\r\\ndo not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them.\\r\\nThere are mechanisms to ensure respect and\\r\\ncompliance with these rules, such as the General\\r\\nAssembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping\\r\\nmissions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an\\r\\neffective international court system should be available\\r\\nto bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the\\r\\nsame time serving to deter potential perpetrators.\\r\\nWith this in mind, I believe that the greatest\\r\\nachievements towards strengthening the international\\r\\nlegal system in recent years have been the\\r\\nestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunals\\r\\nfor the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda\\r\\nand the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\\r\\nInternational Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the\\r\\nRome Statute and encourages all other States to do so.\\r\\nI welcome the proposal to include cooperation\\r\\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\\r\\nin the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I\\r\\nhad the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of\\r\\nthe Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well\\r\\naware of the important contribution made by the\\r\\nCouncil to peace and stability in Europe, especially in\\r\\nthe field of human rights. The United Nations, the\\r\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\r\\n(OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\r\\n(NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations\\r\\n14\\r\\n\\r\\nresponded to the serious situation in the Balkans by\\r\\njoining forces and working together to make\\r\\nreconstruction achievable.\\r\\nIn Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter-\\r\\nethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements\\r\\ncannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by\\r\\nthe international community. One ethnic group must\\r\\nnot be allowed to win at the expense of another. The\\r\\nKosovars have been provided with a unique\\r\\nopportunity to build a just community in the region —\\r\\na community where the fundamental freedoms and\\r\\nrights of every individual and minority group are\\r\\nrespected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are\\r\\nKosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation\\r\\nfor lasting peace and stability for future generations.\\r\\nThe same can be said about similar situations\\r\\nelsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and\\r\\nHerzegovina.\\r\\nThe international community has taken on an\\r\\nenormous task in building a whole new civic structure\\r\\nwithin Kosovo. The development of a legal system and\\r\\nfree media have been two challenging tasks. The\\r\\nelections to take place in October are also going to be\\r\\nchallenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an\\r\\norderly and peaceful manner.\\r\\nIt is very important to include women in the\\r\\npolitical process. In this respect, I would like to\\r\\ncommend the United Nations Development Fund for\\r\\nWomen (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in\\r\\nKosovo, not only in the political field but also in\\r\\nfighting violence against women and in promoting\\r\\nwomen's participation in economic activities.\\r\\nThe importance of human rights in securing long-\\r\\nterm stability and security, both within and between\\r\\ncountries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore\\r\\nessential that no compromises be accepted in this field,\\r\\nand our aims should remain high.\\r\\nThe Security Council should be commended for\\r\\ndiscussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security\\r\\nthreat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in\\r\\nsub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of\\r\\nchildren and armed conflict. The discussion in the\\r\\nCouncil has served to concentrate the attention of the\\r\\ninternational community on these issues and led the\\r\\nway for others to take the measures required. Both\\r\\nissues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect\\r\\nthem to feature prominently on the agenda of next\\r\\nyear's special session to follow up the World Summit\\r\\nfor Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a\\r\\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\\r\\nenormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international\\r\\nefforts to combat it.\\r\\nThe rights of women were significantly enhanced\\r\\nwith the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to\\r\\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\\r\\nDiscrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the\\r\\nProtocol and is preparing its ratification.\\r\\nI cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of\\r\\nthose women around the world who are still enduring\\r\\nmajor human rights abuses, including female genital\\r\\nmutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions\\r\\non their freedom of movement and the right to work.\\r\\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Prime\\r\\nMinister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols\\r\\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland\\r\\nwelcomes their adoption and hopes that they will\\r\\nfurther secure the human rights of children.\\r\\nWe have to put extra effort into working towards\\r\\nthe elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying\\r\\nto note the trend towards increasing racism and\\r\\nxenophobia in certain parts of the world, including\\r\\nEurope. This needs to be fought at all levels. The\\r\\nWorld Conference to be held in South Africa next year\\r\\nwill without doubt play an important role. Iceland\\r\\nwelcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of\\r\\nhistory, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it.\\r\\nAs reflected in the report of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral, “We the peoples”, fighting poverty remains\\r\\none of the main challenges to the United Nations.\\r\\nPeople living in poverty do not have the opportunity to\\r\\nexercise many of their fundamental rights and\\r\\nfreedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of\\r\\nglobalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as\\r\\ndecided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to\\r\\nbe done. Globalization and new technologies offer\\r\\nmany opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate\\r\\nthan in the past.\\r\\nWe have been strengthening our development\\r\\ncooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the\\r\\nbilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of\\r\\nAfrican countries with a focus on strengthening their\\r\\nfishing industry and education and health areas, with\\r\\nthe potential to positively alter the lives of people in\\r\\nneed. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing\\r\\nto the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\nthrough the World Bank and the International Monetary\\r\\nFund.\\r\\nMost of our decisions are based on compromises,\\r\\nin which each and every one of us has to give a little in\\r\\norder to reach an agreement. It is very important to\\r\\nkeep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance,\\r\\nbut also when the time comes for us to pay our dues,\\r\\nboth to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping\\r\\nbudget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this\\r\\nOrganization that all Members pay their contributions\\r\\nfully, on time and without any conditions.\\r\\nIn recent years, the oceans of the world have\\r\\nreceived increased attention in the General Assembly.\\r\\nWe welcome this development. Iceland's economy is\\r\\nbased on the sustainable harvest of living marine\\r\\nresources. The health and responsible stewardship of\\r\\nthe oceans are therefore of critical importance to us.\\r\\nLast year, we resolved to improve United Nations\\r\\ncoordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that\\r\\nend, we established an Informal Consultative Process\\r\\nto discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceans\\r\\nand the law of the sea. I was pleased with the\\r\\nimplementation of this decision of the first Meeting of\\r\\nthis Process last spring.\\r\\nHowever, we must act carefully when seeking to\\r\\nimprove our coordination and cooperation in this area.\\r\\nOcean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level\\r\\nand be consistent with the rights and obligations laid\\r\\ndown in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We\\r\\nmust fully respect the sovereign right of States over\\r\\ntheir natural resources and the competence of existing\\r\\ninternational organizations. Above all, the integrity of\\r\\nthe Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful\\r\\nthat the Convention provides the legal framework\\r\\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must\\r\\nbe carried out.\\r\\nThe United Nations specialized agencies have an\\r\\nimportant role to play in promoting the conservation\\r\\nand sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this\\r\\nrespect is marine scientific research. We need more\\r\\naccurate and policy-oriented information on the state of\\r\\nthe oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a\\r\\nworthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process\\r\\non Ocean Affairs.\\r\\nAt the onset of a new millennium, it is more\\r\\npressing than ever before to ensure the access of people\\r\\nin the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to\\r\\nreadily available and sustainable energy. Today, about\\r\\none third of the world's population does not have such\\r\\naccess, and this situation is obviously a serious\\r\\nobstacle to the development of these communities. In\\r\\nmy country, we have been able to bring sustainable\\r\\nenergy to all households in the country. We are sharing\\r\\nour experience and knowledge with the developing\\r\\ncountries through the United Nations University\\r\\nGeothermal Training Programme, which is located in\\r\\nIceland and funded by my Government.\\r\\nThe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a\\r\\nmomentum for building a secure future for humankind\\r\\nand life on Earth under the banner of sustainable\\r\\ndevelopment. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a\\r\\nglobal conference to take stock of the progress made in\\r\\nmeeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and\\r\\nthe other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have\\r\\nnot been able to live up to all the expectations raised in\\r\\nRio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the\\r\\nprogress that we have made.\\r\\nThe concept of sustainable development has truly\\r\\nbecome accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in\\r\\nenvironmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own\\r\\ncountry, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe\\r\\nthat we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use\\r\\nregime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy\\r\\necosystem and a robust economy. Regional and\\r\\ninternational efforts to prevent the pollution of the\\r\\noceans have continued to gather strength and we can\\r\\nexpect further efforts, in particular to control pollution\\r\\nfrom land-based sources.\\r\\nIt is my belief that, in charting a course for the\\r\\nfuture, we should be looking at success stories and\\r\\nlearning from them, rather than concentrating on the\\r\\nobstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but\\r\\nnot the doom-sayers.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Allow me, Sir, at the outset to congratulate you heartily on your election to the Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a close friend and partner within the Nordic community. We wish you success with this challenging task and pledge to you the full support of the Icelandic delegation. The Millennium Declaration provides the commitments of the world community in the new century. To prevent conflicts, maintain international peace and security and make peace an achievable goal at the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue strengthening the United Nations and the international legal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported verifiable arms control and arms reduction measures and will continue to support realistic disarmament proposals aiming at maximum security with a minimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the enormous sums being spent on weapons, while the money could be used to significantly improve the lives of millions. Today, when there is an obvious need to assess the United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping operations, it has proved extremely important to have a Secretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of the matter through his own experience. I would like to commend the Secretary-General for taking the initiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the field to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi report. Its recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. Even though my country does not have a military, it has been able to participate in peacekeeping operations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing medical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of law, the media and women's rights. We have noted with interest the recommendations made in the Brahimi report concerning the non-military aspects of peace operations. We will be studying them carefully now that we are in the process of looking into how we can strengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the future. The report states that expressions of general support in the form of statements and resolutions must be followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking these words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making. In the preparations for the Millennium Assembly, the Secretary-General encouraged Member States to engage more effectively in the international legal framework by acceding to a number of legal instruments. One to which Iceland has decided to accede is the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. The Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded in reflecting the tremendous changes in the international arena which have taken place since its establishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years to come, the reform process has to be accelerated. The rules of international law governing the relations between States are now well established; this also applies in the fields of human rights and humanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and obligations of States and individuals. But ground rules do not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them. There are mechanisms to ensure respect and compliance with these rules, such as the General Assembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping missions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an effective international court system should be available to bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the same time serving to deter potential perpetrators. With this in mind, I believe that the greatest achievements towards strengthening the international legal system in recent years have been the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the Rome Statute and encourages all other States to do so. I welcome the proposal to include cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I had the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well aware of the important contribution made by the Council to peace and stability in Europe, especially in the field of human rights. The United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations 14  responded to the serious situation in the Balkans by joining forces and working together to make reconstruction achievable. In Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter- ethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements cannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by the international community. One ethnic group must not be allowed to win at the expense of another. The Kosovars have been provided with a unique opportunity to build a just community in the region — a community where the fundamental freedoms and rights of every individual and minority group are respected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are Kosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation for lasting peace and stability for future generations. The same can be said about similar situations elsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international community has taken on an enormous task in building a whole new civic structure within Kosovo. The development of a legal system and free media have been two challenging tasks. The elections to take place in October are also going to be challenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an orderly and peaceful manner. It is very important to include women in the political process. In this respect, I would like to commend the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in Kosovo, not only in the political field but also in fighting violence against women and in promoting women's participation in economic activities. The importance of human rights in securing long- term stability and security, both within and between countries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore essential that no compromises be accepted in this field, and our aims should remain high. The Security Council should be commended for discussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security threat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of children and armed conflict. The discussion in the Council has served to concentrate the attention of the international community on these issues and led the way for others to take the measures required. Both issues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect them to feature prominently on the agenda of next year's special session to follow up the World Summit for Children.

We are sharing our experience and knowledge with the developing countries through the United Nations University Geothermal Training Programme, which is located in Iceland and funded by my Government. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a momentum for building a secure future for humankind and life on Earth under the banner of sustainable development. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a global conference to take stock of the progress made in meeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and the other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have not been able to live up to all the expectations raised in Rio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the progress that we have made. The concept of sustainable development has truly become accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in environmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own country, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe that we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use regime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy ecosystem and a robust economy. Regional and international efforts to prevent the pollution of the oceans have continued to gather strength and we can expect further efforts, in particular to control pollution from land-based sources. It is my belief that, in charting a course for the future, we should be looking at success stories and learning from them, rather than concentrating on the obstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but not the doom-sayers.</td>\n",

It took\\r\\nintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex\\r\\ncase in such a concise and forceful way. We are\\r\\ngrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for\\r\\nproducing it.\\r\\n“We, the peoples” are of course the opening\\r\\nwords of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point\\r\\nof departure. Other speakers have done so before me\\r\\nand have argued in favour of a more robust structure\\r\\nfor keeping the peace in the world community. They\\r\\nare right. The United Nations role in the area of\\r\\npreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as\\r\\nits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown\\r\\nhow, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping\\r\\nfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. The\\r\\nBrahimi recommendations deserve to be\\r\\nimplemented — the sooner the better. At present, the\\r\\nNetherlands Government and parliament are debating\\r\\nhow to improve our national contribution to\\r\\npeacekeeping.\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\n“We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a\\r\\ntotally different side of the United Nations reality as\\r\\nwell. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in\\r\\nfavour of closer ties between the United Nations and\\r\\nthe private sector.\\r\\nIn 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter\\r\\nhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of\\r\\nlife as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and\\r\\nsecurity to social justice, from economic cooperation to\\r\\nhuman rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly\\r\\nmentions any other actors besides States. Non-\\r\\ngovernmental organizations appear in the Charter only\\r\\nonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. In\\r\\nother words, the Charter conforms to a model of\\r\\ngovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state\\r\\nsystem going back to the mid-1600s.\\r\\nIn order to strategize for the future, we need to\\r\\nask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world\\r\\ntoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; and\\r\\nhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?\\r\\nThe United Nations is made up of Member States.\\r\\nThat is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians\\r\\nof foreign relations for a long time to come. But their\\r\\nroles have changed significantly with time. States can\\r\\nno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of\\r\\ninternational relations. Internationalization has altered\\r\\nthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous\\r\\nentities as before, pursuing self-defined national\\r\\ninterests. Their actions are now much more shaped by\\r\\neconomic pressures, information flows, and population\\r\\nmovements. For States, too, globalization is here to\\r\\nstay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and\\r\\ninternational scenes. Civil society is one. The private\\r\\nsector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of\\r\\nnon-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide\\r\\nspectrum, beyond any expectation of the United\\r\\nNations founding fathers. Many non-governmental\\r\\norganizations operate across national boundaries. At\\r\\nthe present time, the United Nations system could\\r\\nnever hope to operate properly without the assistance\\r\\nof non-governmental organizations, not to mention\\r\\nnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental\\r\\norganizations have acquired access to the United\\r\\nNations at different levels, and participate in many of\\r\\nits discussions.\\r\\nAlthough a potent actor on the domestic and\\r\\ninternational levels, the private sector has been\\r\\nvirtually ignored by traditional United Nations\\r\\ndiplomacy. The business community, and notably\\r\\ntransnational corporations, were viewed by many as the\\r\\ncompetitor, if not as the enemy of international public\\r\\ninterest. Documents critical of multinationals were\\r\\nbeing issued by the United Nations and the specialized\\r\\nagencies until recently. Confrontation rather than\\r\\ndialogue. I am not contending that there were no\\r\\ngrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However,\\r\\nnowadays we see a growing awareness in the business\\r\\ncommunity of the necessity of responsible corporate\\r\\npolicies and of a role for private enterprise in the\\r\\npursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing\\r\\nimmediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global\\r\\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the\\r\\npharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with\\r\\ninternational organizations, Governments and other\\r\\nactors.\\r\\nWe need to build on that. Indeed, the time has\\r\\ncome to expand the concept of a partnership with the\\r\\nprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the\\r\\nworld is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the\\r\\nprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power in\\r\\nthe international arena.\\r\\nAbout the odds: take a sustainable future, where\\r\\nelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not\\r\\neven the most powerful Government can put a stop to\\r\\nglobal warming — nor all the Member States of the\\r\\nUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needs\\r\\nto be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society\\r\\nand the scientific community. For equitable working\\r\\nconditions, and other forms of social justice, States\\r\\nneed to involve the private sector. The same is true for\\r\\nfighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting\\r\\nwater or AIDS.\\r\\nWe have truly entered an era that is very different\\r\\nfrom the one in which the United Nations was born —\\r\\nan era in which the course of humanity and the quality\\r\\nof life on earth have more and more become a shared\\r\\nresponsibility; an era where Governments, the private\\r\\nsector and civil society are drawn ever more closely\\r\\ntogether. They all have a stake in global governance.\\r\\nThe so-called global public goods are a matter for all of\\r\\nthem together.\\r\\nThe private sector has a stake in the future of the\\r\\nplanet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no\\r\\nplanet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own\\r\\ninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight\\r\\nin international relations and the influence they have at\\r\\n16\\r\\n\\r\\nthe domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want\\r\\na livable world for their grandchildren. The private\\r\\nsector must be called upon to enter into a responsible\\r\\ncorporate partnership in sync with other actors at the\\r\\ninternational plane. True, the role of each actor needs\\r\\nto be different. Their motivation can remain different,\\r\\ntoo — as does the legal basis on which they act. But\\r\\ntheir determination needs to be the same: the\\r\\ndetermination to secure the longevity of life as we\\r\\nknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet an\\r\\nequitable share of its bounty.\\r\\nDifferent roles, shared responsibility. That\\r\\nconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.\\r\\nThe United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a\\r\\ngalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the\\r\\ncoming century if it cannot show that its debates and\\r\\nits action platforms reflect the real world outside the\\r\\nconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations\\r\\nas “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium\\r\\nreport puts it — it must be able to show that all players\\r\\nare on the stage.\\r\\nThe Secretary-General's Global Compact could\\r\\nnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is the\\r\\nmere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising\\r\\nstart. The Global Compact deserves the active support\\r\\nof the international community, and it deserves to be\\r\\njoined by other multinationals. I do understand the\\r\\ntrepidations of some non-governmental organizations\\r\\nwho fear that multinational corporations will drape\\r\\nthemselves in the United Nations flag and become\\r\\nuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too,\\r\\nthe apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who\\r\\nhave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State\\r\\nand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the\\r\\nGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.\\r\\nAnd I will go even further. We have given civil\\r\\nsociety structural access to the United Nations system.\\r\\nBy contrast, the access we are giving to the private\\r\\nsector, with the notable exception of the International\\r\\nLabour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural.\\r\\nIn the future, we must create appropriate channels of\\r\\ncommunication with the private sector, inside this\\r\\nOrganization, where they, as well as Governments and\\r\\ncivil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions\\r\\nof our time — a forum where, at the very least, they\\r\\ncan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of\\r\\nmistrust that have divided them for so long.\\r\\nThat is the first reason why the United Nations\\r\\nneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.\\r\\nThe second is the power of the private sector. Many\\r\\ncompanies have turnovers larger than the national\\r\\nbudgets of some Member States, and the same is true\\r\\nfor the personal fortunes of some chief executive\\r\\nofficers. The relationship between States and the\\r\\nprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. States\\r\\nwere once thought of as bulwarks against harmful\\r\\neconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight was\\r\\nviewed as a trump card in the power play among\\r\\nnations. Today, States are increasingly serving as\\r\\ninstruments for adjusting domestic policy to the\\r\\nrealities of the present-day world economy. They have\\r\\nbecome intermediaries between the world economy,\\r\\nwith its own structure of power, and domestic societies.\\r\\nThis brings up the question of where world affairs\\r\\nare being conducted and how they have caused a shift\\r\\nin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has\\r\\nshifted the focus of attention to forums other than the\\r\\nUnited Nations here in New York, notably to the\\r\\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\\r\\nWorld Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the\\r\\nEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins of\\r\\nthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decided\\r\\nelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.\\r\\nThat focus has brought on a different cast of players\\r\\nthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign\\r\\nMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only with\\r\\ndevelopment ministers, but also with finance and trade\\r\\nministers, as well as with central bankers. International\\r\\naffairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about\\r\\neconomics.\\r\\nForging a relationship with the private sector is\\r\\ntherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to\\r\\npreserve its relevance over the long haul. The\\r\\nmultilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties\\r\\nwith other centres of power and with the business\\r\\ncommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously\\r\\npursuing closer relations with all these various forums,\\r\\nand we encourage him to do more of the same.\\r\\nResponsible corporate partnership is also about\\r\\nprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not\\r\\nonly to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure\\r\\nfreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages,\\r\\nglobalization is leaving too many victims by the\\r\\nwayside. The gap between the rich and the poor\\r\\ncontinues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in\\r\\nwar and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\na great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will\\r\\nbuy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly\\r\\non the quality of life in many developing countries.\\r\\nEven though the odds are staggering, the United\\r\\nNations system can make a difference in reducing\\r\\npoverty, gender inequality and child and maternal\\r\\nmortality. But it can make a difference only from a\\r\\nposition of strength and from a platform shared by\\r\\nother actors at the international level: from a position\\r\\nof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has\\r\\ndeclared poverty eradication the United Nations\\r\\nnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fighting\\r\\npoverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has\\r\\nbeen; it has also become an economic one. That is\\r\\nanother reason for the United Nations to become more\\r\\ninclusive of the private sector.\\r\\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We\\r\\nthe peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take\\r\\nthe United Nations forward. Whatever the way\\r\\nforward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we\\r\\nhave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we\\r\\nhave kept the United Nations on a very short leash,\\r\\nhardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of\\r\\nthe same is not enough. In other words, the United\\r\\nNations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples,\\r\\npursue our business as usual. The future will pass us\\r\\nby.\\r\\nThe alternative is an avenue that is much more\\r\\nambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations\\r\\nsystem as a vehicle for the development of a new\\r\\nvision of world politics, a vision for the “post-\\r\\nWestphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends\\r\\nwould be given legitimacy and a conceptual\\r\\nframework. In such a vision, the principle of non-\\r\\nintervention yields to the defence of human rights;\\r\\nsovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for\\r\\ncivil society and the private sector; and economics are\\r\\nalso held responsible for social and development goals.\\r\\nSuch is the road less travelled, but the only one that\\r\\ncan make all the difference.</td>\n",

If we want to see the United Nations as “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium report puts it — it must be able to show that all players are on the stage. The Secretary-General's Global Compact could not have come at a more opportune moment. It is the mere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising start. The Global Compact deserves the active support of the international community, and it deserves to be joined by other multinationals. I do understand the trepidations of some non-governmental organizations who fear that multinational corporations will drape themselves in the United Nations flag and become untouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too, the apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who have a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State and its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the Global Compact is not a Trojan horse. And I will go even further. We have given civil society structural access to the United Nations system. By contrast, the access we are giving to the private sector, with the notable exception of the International Labour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural. In the future, we must create appropriate channels of communication with the private sector, inside this Organization, where they, as well as Governments and civil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions of our time — a forum where, at the very least, they can deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of mistrust that have divided them for so long. That is the first reason why the United Nations needs to broaden its scope and become more inclusive. The second is the power of the private sector. Many companies have turnovers larger than the national budgets of some Member States, and the same is true for the personal fortunes of some chief executive officers. The relationship between States and the private sector has altered dramatically over time. States were once thought of as bulwarks against harmful economic impact from abroad. Economic weight was viewed as a trump card in the power play among nations. Today, States are increasingly serving as instruments for adjusting domestic policy to the realities of the present-day world economy. They have become intermediaries between the world economy, with its own structure of power, and domestic societies. This brings up the question of where world affairs are being conducted and how they have caused a shift in the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has shifted the focus of attention to forums other than the United Nations here in New York, notably to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the European Union. Policies are tested in the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos or decided elsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs. That focus has brought on a different cast of players than in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign Ministers now work shoulder to shoulder not only with development ministers, but also with finance and trade ministers, as well as with central bankers. International affairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about economics. Forging a relationship with the private sector is therefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to preserve its relevance over the long haul. The multilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties with other centres of power and with the business community. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously pursuing closer relations with all these various forums, and we encourage him to do more of the same. Responsible corporate partnership is also about protecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not only to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure freedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages, globalization is leaving too many victims by the wayside. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in war and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields 17  a great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will buy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly on the quality of life in many developing countries. Even though the odds are staggering, the United Nations system can make a difference in reducing poverty, gender inequality and child and maternal mortality. But it can make a difference only from a position of strength and from a platform shared by other actors at the international level: from a position of shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has declared poverty eradication the United Nations number one priority. We applaud that. But fighting poverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has been; it has also become an economic one. That is another reason for the United Nations to become more inclusive of the private sector. The Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We the peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take the United Nations forward. Whatever the way forward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we have been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we have kept the United Nations on a very short leash, hardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of the same is not enough. In other words, the United Nations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples, pursue our business as usual. The future will pass us by. The alternative is an avenue that is much more ambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations system as a vehicle for the development of a new vision of world politics, a vision for the “post- Westphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends would be given legitimacy and a conceptual framework. In such a vision, the principle of non- intervention yields to the defence of human rights; sovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for civil society and the private sector; and economics are also held responsible for social and development goals. Such is the road less travelled, but the only one that can make all the difference.</td>\n",

                           India congratulates Mr. Harri\\r\\nHolkeri on his election as President of the first General\\r\\nAssembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that\\r\\nhe intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the\\r\\nmandate for the work of the Organization during his\\r\\npresidency.\\r\\nI take this opportunity to sincerely compliment\\r\\nand to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign\\r\\nMinister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his\\r\\nguidance of the General Assembly in the past year,\\r\\nwhich included three special sessions and, of course,\\r\\nmeticulous preparations for and a successful\\r\\nconclusion to the Millennium Summit.\\r\\nI join India's voice to those of other delegations\\r\\nin noting with appreciation the dedication with which\\r\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United\\r\\nNations at a critical point.\\r\\nI am delighted on this occasion to warmly\\r\\nwelcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United\\r\\nNations.\\r\\nJust 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and\\r\\nGovernment assembled here for the Millennium\\r\\nSummit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as\\r\\nunique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium\\r\\nDeclaration that was then adopted encapsulates a\\r\\nshared vision that the international community work\\r\\ntogether in constructive cooperation to meet collective\\r\\nchallenges, within the framework of the United\\r\\nNations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister\\r\\nspoke, as did many others, of the need for the United\\r\\nNations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first\\r\\ncentury, to make it an effective instrument to translate\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\nour vision into reality. The United Nations is the house\\r\\nthat we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that\\r\\nit is equal to our collective expectations and our joint\\r\\naspirations.\\r\\nPeace, collective security and development\\r\\ninspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the\\r\\ntwenty-first century with extraordinary collective\\r\\nintellectual and technical capabilities. These are our\\r\\nglobal tools for overcoming the challenges before us.\\r\\nPeace and security for all is not just possible but is well\\r\\nwithin our grasp. Stability and development are the\\r\\nessential building blocks for the maintenance of peace\\r\\nand security. Threats to peace can and do arise from\\r\\ndifferent sources. It is not just weapons of mass\\r\\ndestruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but\\r\\nalso dehumanizing poverty and lack of development.\\r\\nWe must act as confident nation States committed\\r\\nto collective action and international cooperation, for\\r\\nthese are our means to provide wider effects of peace\\r\\nand progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect\\r\\nfor State sovereignty and non-interference in internal\\r\\naffairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must\\r\\nabjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances\\r\\nwarrant action by the Security Council, that action\\r\\nmust be firmly rooted in Charter provisions.\\r\\nThe Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of\\r\\nproposals. We recommend that the General Assembly\\r\\nexamine this important report carefully and take\\r\\nappropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United\\r\\nNations function of peacekeeping.\\r\\nWe support the Middle East peace process and\\r\\nfind the trend encouraging.\\r\\nThe historic summit between the Republic of\\r\\nKorea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\\r\\ntoo, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula.\\r\\nDisarmament — global nuclear disarmament in\\r\\nparticular — is essential to engender a greater sense of\\r\\nsecurity among Member States. India has been and will\\r\\ncontinue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global\\r\\nnuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation.\\r\\nWe welcome the recommendation of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral in his report to the Millennium Summit to\\r\\nconvene an international conference on eliminating\\r\\nnuclear danger. We urge commencement of\\r\\nnegotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring\\r\\nabout a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains\\r\\nready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps,\\r\\nsuch as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering\\r\\nnuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as\\r\\nwell as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non-\\r\\nuse of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon\\r\\nStates.\\r\\nThe situation with regard to the entry into force\\r\\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\\r\\n(CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of\\r\\nwork at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva\\r\\nshow the importance of building a consensus, both\\r\\nwithin and amongst nations, on issues that affect\\r\\nnational and international security. We are conscious\\r\\nthat 155 countries are at present signatories of the\\r\\nCTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing\\r\\ncommitment that India does not wish to stand in the\\r\\nway of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered\\r\\nto observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on\\r\\nfurther explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic\\r\\nobligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to\\r\\nengage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference\\r\\non Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban\\r\\nthe future production of fissile material for weapons\\r\\npurposes.\\r\\nThe illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of\\r\\nsmall arms, particularly by States to non-State actors\\r\\nand to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with\\r\\nterrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep\\r\\nconcern to the world community. When they are\\r\\ncombined with religious fanaticism and military\\r\\nadventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized\\r\\nnorms to which we strive to adhere. The international\\r\\ncommunity can no longer afford to permit these\\r\\npurveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue\\r\\nto inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look\\r\\nforward to a successful outcome of the United Nations\\r\\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\\r\\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year.\\r\\nTerrorism is the global menace of our age. For\\r\\nsome, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has\\r\\nbeen the object of State-sponsored, cross-border\\r\\nterrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more\\r\\nthan a decade. Even as the international community\\r\\nworks together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit\\r\\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we need to\\r\\ncontinually focus our attention on the users of such\\r\\nweapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on\\r\\nhuman decency, a violation of the basic precepts of\\r\\ndemocracy and the very antithesis of what the United\\r\\nNations represents and stands for. Because its principal\\r\\n18\\r\\n\\r\\ntargets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant\\r\\nviolation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime\\r\\nagainst humanity. It is also a threat to international\\r\\npeace and security, especially when terrorists are\\r\\narmed, financed and backed by Governments or their\\r\\nagencies.\\r\\nI urge all Members to work to strengthen the\\r\\ninternational consensus and legal regimes against\\r\\nterrorism. We have proposed the draft of a\\r\\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. I\\r\\nurge all Members of the United Nations to give their\\r\\ntotal support to this initiative.\\r\\nLet me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our\\r\\nchoice to accomplish our global agenda: the United\\r\\nNations. There is but one United Nations; none\\r\\nreplicate it, nor can any replace it.\\r\\nThe membership of the United Nations has\\r\\nincreased manifold in the last half century, and today\\r\\nstands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to\\r\\nhave the same basic structure as in the colonized world\\r\\nof 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of\\r\\nthe Security Council in both permanent and non-\\r\\npermanent categories is self-evident. The impact of\\r\\nactions of the Security Council is felt, with near total\\r\\nexclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have\\r\\nlittle influence in its decision-making. We have a\\r\\nglobal consensus that the form taken by the Security\\r\\nCouncil in the aftermath of the Second World War is\\r\\noutmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an\\r\\nenlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more\\r\\nthan 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need\\r\\nfor a Council reformed in its representation. An\\r\\nunrepresentative Security Council will lack the range\\r\\nand depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and\\r\\nunderstanding of the realities that it will have to deal\\r\\nwith or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm\\r\\nIndia's willingness to take on the responsibilities of\\r\\npermanent membership.\\r\\nThe General Assembly is the most important\\r\\norgan of the United Nations. It is here that all States,\\r\\nirrespective of considerations of strength, economy or\\r\\nsize, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic\\r\\nprinciple of sovereign equality. There is a growing\\r\\nfeeling among Member States that the functioning and\\r\\nrole of the General Assembly has to be made more\\r\\neffective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce\\r\\ndistance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together\\r\\ninto a new global neighbourhood as never before in\\r\\nhistory, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead\\r\\nus to increasing interdependence, our canvas of\\r\\ninternational cooperation and collective action has\\r\\nrapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more\\r\\ncomplex. The General Assembly has therefore to be\\r\\ncentral in accepting this new responsibility, this new\\r\\nchallenge.\\r\\nEven as we week to strengthen democratic\\r\\nprinciples and practices in the United Nations, and\\r\\neven as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside\\r\\ndictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have\\r\\nunfortunately witnessed some instances of regression\\r\\nas well. Such acts move against the currents of our\\r\\ntimes. The international community should oppose\\r\\nthese assaults on the spirit of our times and\\r\\nuncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic\\r\\nimpulses, practices and norms. It should show its\\r\\nsolidarity with the people of such countries. The\\r\\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\\r\\ndeserve our commendation for the steps they have\\r\\ntaken in this regard.\\r\\nDevelopments in Fiji since 19 May this year have\\r\\ncaused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken\\r\\nby the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the\\r\\nconstitutionally elected democratic Government there.\\r\\nWe hope that Fiji will return immediately to the\\r\\nconstitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law\\r\\nat the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial\\r\\ndiscrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest.\\r\\nWe hope that the international community will exercise\\r\\nits collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back\\r\\nto the road of democracy and the rule of law.\\r\\nIt appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten\\r\\nAfghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country\\r\\ncontinues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the\\r\\nmirage of military success. It also continues because of\\r\\noutside support, military and financial, to the Taliban.\\r\\nThis conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist\\r\\nideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the\\r\\nAfghan people. This adversely affects the peace and\\r\\nsecurity of the entire neighbourhood, from West to\\r\\nCentral Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate\\r\\nfrom the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in\\r\\nthe shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of\\r\\narms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The\\r\\nTaliban and their mentor must heed the world's\\r\\ndemands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for\\r\\na comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that\\r\\n19\\r\\n\\r\\nrestores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests\\r\\nand aspirations of all sections of that society.\\r\\nWe have consistently called upon the United\\r\\nNations to increase its development orientation and\\r\\nengagement, which is a core responsibility. We\\r\\nwelcome and support the declaration of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral last week to the United Nations Development\\r\\nProgramme's ministerial meeting that deficit in\\r\\ndevelopment will put in jeopardy all other goals of the\\r\\nUnited Nations. To address the root causes of poverty\\r\\nmeaningfully, we need firm international commitments\\r\\nto re-order and reshape international relations, in\\r\\nconsequence providing for equitable opportunities to\\r\\ndeveloping countries for resource earnings. Our call is\\r\\neven more relevant in today's fast integrating world.\\r\\nDeveloping countries and their people cannot\\r\\nthrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We\\r\\ntherefore hope that the forthcoming conference on\\r\\nfinancing for development would endorse concrete\\r\\ninitiatives for mobilization of the required external\\r\\nresources for development, whether from trade or\\r\\nconcessional flows, and treat this as a shared global\\r\\ngoal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the\\r\\ndifference that would be made if there was universal\\r\\nadherence to the agreed official development\\r\\nassistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross\\r\\nNational Product(GNP), within a specified time frame.\\r\\nNowhere is this more important than in the\\r\\ncontinent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be\\r\\nadequately supported by the international community.\\r\\nWe believe that issues relating to the development of\\r\\nAfrican countries must remain at the forefront of the\\r\\nwork of the General Assembly.\\r\\nThe process of globalization, with revolutionary\\r\\nleaps in communications and the great advance in\\r\\ninformation technology and increased mobility of\\r\\ncapital, trade and technology, has produced new\\r\\npotential for sustained economic growth. The benefits\\r\\nof globalization have, however, not percolated to the\\r\\nvast sections who live mired in poverty, without\\r\\nshelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has\\r\\noften been accompanied by enhanced poverty,\\r\\nunemployment and consequent social disintegration.\\r\\nThis poses a major challenge. We have to determine an\\r\\ninclusive concept of growth and development. We have\\r\\nto strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense,\\r\\nand not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While\\r\\nGDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to\\r\\ngrowth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and\\r\\nenhancement of the quality of life and creation of real\\r\\nchoices must be integral to the process of assessing the\\r\\nsuccess of development efforts.\\r\\nIn India, we have formulated development\\r\\nstrategies on the premise that economic and social\\r\\npolicies must subserve the primacy of the human being,\\r\\nand in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth\\r\\nalone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee\\r\\nsocial justice is crucial. Development based on uneven\\r\\nrewards will not be supported by those who are not its\\r\\nbeneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric.\\r\\nThe fullest possible participation of the people in the\\r\\ndevelopment process is the best guarantee for the\\r\\nsuccess of any growth strategy.\\r\\nMany challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to\\r\\nsustained economic growth for developing countries\\r\\nabound. Protectionist tendencies in developed\\r\\ncountries, a lack of political will to implement\\r\\ncommitments undertaken regarding development\\r\\nfinance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of\\r\\ndeveloping countries aggravate the situation. Special\\r\\nand differential treatment for developing countries\\r\\nguaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO)\\r\\nprovisions must be translated into operational reality.\\r\\nDeveloped countries should not seek to restrict market\\r\\naccess to goods and services and free movement of\\r\\nnatural persons, especially at a time when developing\\r\\ncountries are being asked to open up their economies\\r\\nand compete in the international economic domain.\\r\\nAnother challenge relates to reconciling the needs\\r\\nof economic and industrial growth with the need for\\r\\npreservation and protection of the environment. A safe\\r\\nand healthy environment for our peoples is an\\r\\nimperative. At the same time, all development cannot\\r\\nbe sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental\\r\\npreservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and\\r\\nenvironmental conservation cannot and should not\\r\\nimply maintenance of poverty.\\r\\nDeveloping countries have done commendable\\r\\nwork in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the\\r\\ncontext of an exceptionally difficult global\\r\\nenvironment. The promised resources from developed\\r\\ncountries have failed to materialize. The transfer of\\r\\ntechnologies on preferential and concessional terms has\\r\\nnot been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed\\r\\non technology transfer even on commercial terms. The\\r\\nspecial session of the United Nations General\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\nAssembly on the review and appraisal of the\\r\\nimplementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should\\r\\nconcentrate on finding solutions in addressing such\\r\\nunfulfilled commitments and providing reality and\\r\\noperational content to the declaration that “eradication\\r\\nof poverty is the over-riding priority of developing\\r\\ncountries”.\\r\\nChildren and issues relating to them are a priority.\\r\\nWe hope that the special session of the General\\r\\nAssembly next year will concentrate on the\\r\\nimplementation of the Declaration of the World\\r\\nSummit on Children.\\r\\nAdvancement of the democratic spirit and\\r\\novercoming challenges to it, growth with equity,\\r\\neconomic development with social justice and, as the\\r\\nprize that we seek, the creation of a world where\\r\\ninjustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and\\r\\nwelfare for all are among the goals that we should set\\r\\nfor ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The\\r\\nchallenge is nothing less than collective enlightened\\r\\nglobal ownership.\\r\\nThe General Assembly once again faces a heavy\\r\\nand challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let\\r\\nus wish ourselves success in our endeavours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   \n",

I\\r\\nam confident that his vision and energy will guide this\\r\\nsession to a successful conclusion.\\r\\nI also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the\\r\\nfifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with\\r\\ndistinction and efficiency.\\r\\nI commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed\\r\\nSecretary-General of this Organization, for the\\r\\nthoughtful recommendations which he has put forward\\r\\nin his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We\\r\\nthe peoples: the role of the United Nations in the\\r\\ntwenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have\\r\\nproved to be vital factors in advancing the work and\\r\\nmission of the United Nations at this critical time in the\\r\\nhistory of the Organization and the world.\\r\\nI join the previous speakers in welcoming the\\r\\nnation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of\\r\\nthe United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also\\r\\nthe smallest Member country of the Organization, with\\r\\na population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square\\r\\nmiles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the\\r\\nleader of that nation proudly take his place among the\\r\\nother leaders of the world in what was the largest\\r\\ngathering of heads of State or Government ever\\r\\nassembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There\\r\\nis a special affinity between the countries of the\\r\\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We\\r\\nare among the smallest constituents of the\\r\\nOrganization. We share similar historical and\\r\\nconstitutional experiences. We face the same\\r\\nenvironmental threats. We look forward, with\\r\\nconfidence, to a future involving the creative\\r\\n29\\r\\n\\r\\nutilization of the phenomenal developments in the area\\r\\nof information technology.\\r\\nMy country's Prime Minister, The Right\\r\\nHonourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders\\r\\nfrom the Caribbean Community, of which he is the\\r\\ncurrent Chairman, in denouncing the growing\\r\\ninsensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of\\r\\nsmall developing countries on the part of the powerful\\r\\nin today's world. In his address to the Millennium\\r\\nSummit the Prime Minister noted that while our\\r\\nreligious heritage has taught us how to reach across the\\r\\nboundaries of nations through the very inspirational\\r\\nguideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and\\r\\nvulnerable island States such as our own are being\\r\\nvictimized by the application of international rules\\r\\ncrafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes,\\r\\noblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the\\r\\nwell-being, of others. We are all affected by the\\r\\nmodalities of the global village which we inhabit,\\r\\nthrough revolutionary developments in communication\\r\\ntechnology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours,\\r\\nand yet the competition among the world's peoples has\\r\\nbecome fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead\\r\\nand widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is\\r\\nnow related not only to material wealth, but also,\\r\\nfrighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries\\r\\nto compete in the accepted medium of communication,\\r\\nbecause of the existence of an ever-widening digital\\r\\ndivide.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit concluded with the\\r\\nadoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming\\r\\nthe importance of the United Nations and the need to\\r\\nstrengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as\\r\\nmaking commitments to targeted reductions in poverty,\\r\\nthe levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by\\r\\nimpoverished nations around the world, the incidence\\r\\nand spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic\\r\\neducation for all children. On the other hand, we are\\r\\naware that the current world order is rapidly falling out\\r\\nof step with today's realities and that there is a pressing\\r\\nneed for the international community to come together\\r\\nand address the numerous challenges before us.\\r\\nWe must acknowledge that efforts to address old\\r\\nissues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well\\r\\nas new ones arising from globalization, the rapid\\r\\ngrowth of information technology and the resulting\\r\\ndigital divide, the consequences of the environmental\\r\\ndegradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender\\r\\nissues, among others, have largely been inadequate.\\r\\nOur common and daunting task is therefore to ensure\\r\\nthat this globalized world will be beneficial for all and\\r\\nnot just for some. More than ever before, there is an\\r\\nurgent need to foster a consciousness of universal\\r\\nmoral values in order to deal with present-day\\r\\nproblems, all of which are assuming an increasingly\\r\\nglobal dimension. The promotion of peace and human\\r\\nrights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and\\r\\namong States, the protection of immigrants, the\\r\\nsafeguarding of the environment, the battle against\\r\\nterrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms\\r\\ntrafficking, money laundering and economic and\\r\\npolitical corruption are issues which no nation,\\r\\nregardless of how wealthy or powerful, can\\r\\nsuccessfully address alone. They concern the entire\\r\\nhuman community and must be addressed and resolved\\r\\nthrough common universal efforts.\\r\\nMy country, a small State in the Caribbean, has\\r\\nalways been aware of its interdependence with other\\r\\ncountries for its prosperity and security. We have\\r\\nmoved to advance our interests through multilateral\\r\\ncooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean\\r\\nStates (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of\\r\\nAmerican States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean\\r\\nStates (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions\\r\\nof the United Nations system. For a small developing\\r\\ncountry like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\\r\\nmultilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of\\r\\nour policies and programmes to enhance our standard\\r\\nof living and create a better life for all of our people. I\\r\\ntherefore reiterate my country's commitment to and\\r\\nsupport for the work of the United Nations and its\\r\\nagencies in this regard.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit provided an appropriate\\r\\nopportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate\\r\\nthemselves to the attempt to have an impact on and\\r\\nchange for the better the quality of life of the world's\\r\\npoorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of\\r\\ndeprivation and suffering. The Summit will have\\r\\nproved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new\\r\\nmillennium, but as an event that made the transition\\r\\nfrom words to deeds. The times demand nothing less.\\r\\nThe security, welfare and development of people\\r\\nmust, in the context of any new world order, dominate\\r\\nthe attention of the world's multilateral financial\\r\\ninstitutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must\\r\\nundertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our\\r\\npeople from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease.\\r\\n30\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation\\r\\nprogrammes have been successful, much needs to be\\r\\ndone to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions\\r\\nstill suffer from hunger.\\r\\nWe had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera\\r\\nand tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and\\r\\ndrug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS\\r\\nare spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the\\r\\nCaribbean Community have placed combating this\\r\\npandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This\\r\\nscourge has already claimed the lives of over 10\\r\\nmillion people. It is projected to claim the lives of over\\r\\n200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in\\r\\nsub-Saharan Africa.\\r\\nThe developed world is not spared, either.\\r\\nWorldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are\\r\\nliving with the disease, over 18 million have died since\\r\\nthe beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million\\r\\nchildren have become orphaned. In the Caribbean\\r\\nregion, the disease now threatens the human resource\\r\\ndevelopment efforts of CARICOM and could reverse\\r\\nthe social and economic gains of the countries in that\\r\\nsubregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean\\r\\nis estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the\\r\\nhighest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second,\\r\\nin terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A\\r\\nUnited Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over\\r\\n360,000 adults and children in our region were living\\r\\nwith the disease. There is no immunity. International\\r\\ncooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields\\r\\nmust be intensified if the disease is to be contained.\\r\\nWe cannot preach about human rights and the\\r\\nuniversality of the United Nations while at the same\\r\\ntime ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people\\r\\nin the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of\\r\\nthe Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that\\r\\nthe time has come when serious consideration should\\r\\nbe given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on\\r\\nTaiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In\\r\\nthis regard, my Government is urging that the subject\\r\\nbe placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the\\r\\nGeneral Assembly. We urge every Member State of this\\r\\nnoble Organization to give its full support to this\\r\\nworthy initiative for a country whose democratic\\r\\ncredentials cannot be challenged.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\\r\\nprogress made in the Middle East peace process thus\\r\\nfar, and expresses the hope that through dialogue,\\r\\ncompromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace\\r\\nmay become a reality.\\r\\nIf countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\\r\\nare to survive globalization, the international\\r\\ncommunity must give careful and urgent consideration\\r\\nto the following measures: the revitalization of growth\\r\\nin developed countries; the lowering of interest rates;\\r\\naccess to the world's markets for the products of\\r\\ndeveloping countries; the reduction of debt and the\\r\\ndebt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating\\r\\nsituation in the marketing arrangements for primary\\r\\nproducts produced in the developing countries;\\r\\neconomic diversification; increasing the levels of\\r\\nofficial development assistance and humanitarian aid;\\r\\nreductions in net capital flows from bilateral and\\r\\nmultilateral sources; and combating the negative\\r\\nconsequences of the graduation of some countries like\\r\\nours, by international financial institutions, from\\r\\nconcessionary funding arrangements.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the\\r\\nconcerns of other developing countries with regard to\\r\\nthe general decline in official development assistance\\r\\nand the flow of foreign direct investment to developing\\r\\ncountries. We look forward to the consultation on\\r\\nfinancing for development planned for 2001.\\r\\nThe changing world environment dictates the\\r\\nneed for the revitalization and restructuring of the\\r\\nvarious organs of the United Nations organizations, but\\r\\nmy Government attaches very high priority to the\\r\\nrevitalization and strengthening of the role of the\\r\\nUnited Nations in promoting international cooperation\\r\\nfor sound development, including economic\\r\\ndevelopment. We share the view that the United\\r\\nNations should be encouraged to develop its full\\r\\npotential in the area of international economic\\r\\ncooperation and should be endowed with the requisite\\r\\nresources to contribute to solving the serious economic\\r\\nand social problems facing developing countries in\\r\\ntheir efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nWe commend those donor countries that have\\r\\nmade financial contributions to the South Pacific\\r\\nApplied Geoscience Commission to assist the\\r\\ndevelopment of an environmental vulnerability index,\\r\\nand call for the early adoption by the international\\r\\ncommunity of a vulnerability index that would serve as\\r\\na guide for multilateral financial institutions and the\\r\\n31\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of\\r\\ndeveloping countries.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other\\r\\nsmall island developing States in the strategically\\r\\nlocated Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the\\r\\nendemic problems of the production, trafficking and\\r\\nconsumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic\\r\\nsubstances. This modern day scourge continues to pose\\r\\nserious problems which threaten to destroy the social\\r\\nand moral fabric of our communities. My Government\\r\\nis fully committed to the ongoing process of\\r\\ncooperation with other countries to counter these\\r\\nillegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in\\r\\nthis forum our complete support for the Multilateral\\r\\nEvaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the\\r\\nmember countries of the Organization of American\\r\\nStates (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the\\r\\ninternational fight against the drug trade. I also take\\r\\nthis opportunity to urge that more resources be\\r\\nallocated through collaborative efforts by the\\r\\ninternational community to encourage farmers to keep\\r\\naway from the production of illicit crops.\\r\\nIn his address to the Millennium Summit, the\\r\\nChairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)\\r\\nspoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good\\r\\ngovernance and respect for human rights and\\r\\ndemocracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are\\r\\naspects of our society of which we are eternally proud.\\r\\nRecently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our\\r\\nconstitutional democracy was put to the test through\\r\\nopen expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal\\r\\nthrough dialogue and compromise. My Government is\\r\\npleased to put on record its appreciation to the\\r\\nVincentian people for upholding democratic values and\\r\\nrespecting the supremacy of the constitution and the\\r\\nrule of law as fundamental principles by which our\\r\\nbeloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to\\r\\nexpress gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of\\r\\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to\\r\\nthe National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry\\r\\nand Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to\\r\\nmany individuals and other institutions for their\\r\\ninvaluable contributions in bringing about a swift\\r\\nresolution of the matter. My Government has long\\r\\nrecognized the urgent need for constitutional reform\\r\\nand will continue to work with other interested parties\\r\\nto bring about meaningful change that would seek,\\r\\namong other things, to strengthen the foundations of\\r\\nour democracy. As full members of this body, we have\\r\\nseen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional\\r\\nreform in the promotion of democracy, stability and\\r\\neconomic development.\\r\\nWe also recognize that constitutional reform is\\r\\ncrucial to strengthening our own integration processes\\r\\nwithin the Caribbean Community, including the\\r\\nestablishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be,\\r\\ninter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on\\r\\nmatters pertaining to the interpretation and\\r\\nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty of\\r\\nChaguaramas, which established CARICOM.\\r\\nMany matters of profound importance to Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean\\r\\nCommunity as a whole are included in the agenda of\\r\\nthis fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These\\r\\ninclude: sustainable development, the future of United\\r\\nNations reform, the International Criminal Court and\\r\\nhuman rights, the death penalty and financing for\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nI wish, once again, to focus the attention of this\\r\\nnoble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana\\r\\ntrade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well\\r\\ndocumented. Banana exports to the European Union\\r\\nfrom my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint\\r\\nLucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\\r\\ncountries are crucial to the economies of these\\r\\ncountries and represent over half of all export earnings\\r\\nin some cases. The industry provides substantial\\r\\nemployment for many families in Dominica, Saint\\r\\nLucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own\\r\\ncountry.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative\\r\\nof the efforts of the European Commission and other\\r\\nparties which seek to bring about an amicable and\\r\\nequitable solution to the dispute. However we are\\r\\ndeeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime\\r\\nbe eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with\\r\\nthe 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this\\r\\nwould have immeasurable harmful consequences for\\r\\nour economy. It will lead to the destruction of the\\r\\nCaribbean banana industry and negatively affect other\\r\\nACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to\\r\\nthe economy.\\r\\nThe two alternative solutions being proposed by\\r\\nthe European Commission, that is a first come, first\\r\\nserved system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that\\r\\nproves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only\\r\\nsystem, would prove to be disadvantageous and\\r\\n32\\r\\n\\r\\ndisastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system\\r\\nensures access.\\r\\nWe therefore urge the interested parties to the\\r\\ndispute to use their substantial influence to bring about\\r\\nthe much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a\\r\\nresolution that is acceptable to all parties. An\\r\\nefficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will\\r\\nsupport our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable\\r\\nisland State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining\\r\\npeace and economic security, which are vital for the\\r\\nachievement of economic diversification within a\\r\\nreasonable period of transition.\\r\\nWhile we recognize that there are structural and\\r\\ninherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to\\r\\ncompete with highly integrated operations on the\\r\\nmarket, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in\\r\\norder to allow our people to engage meaningfully in\\r\\ntrade and development, rather than be forever subjected\\r\\nto the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed\\r\\ndesire to hold on to our banana industry, which served\\r\\nus well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the\\r\\nrealities of the present day trade and economic\\r\\nenvironment.\\r\\nMy delegation also wishes to express its concern\\r\\nover the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within\\r\\nthe WTO that would prevent consideration of the\\r\\nwaiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU\\r\\nPartnership Agreement if it includes bananas without\\r\\nadvice on how the regime will be formed. My country\\r\\nand other members of the Caribbean Community have\\r\\nbeen actively engaged in diversifying our economies\\r\\nthroughout the last quarter of the last century. This has\\r\\ninvolved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing,\\r\\ntourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the\\r\\nGrenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have\\r\\nimproved air access to our country and my Government\\r\\ncontinues to prioritize the education of our people to\\r\\nprepare them for the opportunities that will accrue.\\r\\nMy Government will continue to honour its\\r\\ncommitments to all international agreements to which\\r\\nit is signatory. In furtherance to our international\\r\\nobligation we have signed the following: the United\\r\\nNations Convention on Contracts for the International\\r\\nSale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and\\r\\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United\\r\\nNations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea,\\r\\nthe International Convention Against the Taking of\\r\\nHostages and the Convention on the Prevention and\\r\\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\\r\\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these\\r\\ninstruments were deposited with the Secretary General\\r\\nduring the Millennium Summit.\\r\\nDuring his speech at the Millennium Summit,\\r\\nPrime Minister Mitchell stated that:\\r\\n“Small island States such as our own, with\\r\\nan enviable record of good governance and\\r\\nhuman rights, have seen the mighty in the banana\\r\\ntrade using the international rules — crafted by\\r\\nthem — impede our economic growth.”\\r\\nSimilarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by\\r\\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment (OECD) on our financial services,\\r\\nwithout any deference to our rights to be heard,\\r\\ndemonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small\\r\\nvulnerable States attempting to diversify their\\r\\neconomies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment,\\r\\n“Where is the fairness in free trade?”\\r\\nOffshore financial services is one of our chosen\\r\\navenues of economic diversification. We believe that\\r\\nwe are capable of offering a useful, professional and\\r\\nmutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly,\\r\\nin 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative\\r\\nexercise to ensure that we would put in place a\\r\\nregulatory and supervisory framework to adequately\\r\\nadminister the conduct of international financial\\r\\nbusinesses operating in Saint Vincent and the\\r\\nGrenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our\\r\\nregulatory regime against money laundering activities,\\r\\nwe enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation.\\r\\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being\\r\\na responsible member of the international community,\\r\\nincluding by playing its part in the war against money\\r\\nlaundering. We believe that those who toil to build a\\r\\nbetter life for themselves, their children, their\\r\\ngrandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be\\r\\nafforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such\\r\\npeople should have access to facilities that will\\r\\npreserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be\\r\\ncreated for them to optimize and maximize their\\r\\nwealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we\\r\\nbelieve in the preservation of privacy, we are also\\r\\nresolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable\\r\\ncharacter and conduct are not allowed to take\\r\\nadvantage of the opportunities that are available in our\\r\\ninternational finance sector.\\r\\n33\\r\\n\\r\\nMy country and others in the Caribbean\\r\\nCommunity are deeply concerned that the so-called\\r\\nharmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic\\r\\nCooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to\\r\\nfrustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the\\r\\nsovereignty of small island States desperately seeking\\r\\ncreative avenues for survival. Such action on the part\\r\\nof the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax\\r\\ncartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes\\r\\nfrom those who wish to legitimately escape them\\r\\nthrough the exercise of free choice. It would also close\\r\\noff an area of diversification and economic activity in\\r\\nwhich poor developing countries can be competitive\\r\\nand which they have actively promoted for a long time.\\r\\nThe unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial\\r\\nStability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force\\r\\nalso impact negatively on the burden of taxation in\\r\\nwealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of\\r\\nCaribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global\\r\\nfinancial service and stifle economic growth in the 47\\r\\nblacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils.\\r\\nThe small island States of the Caribbean are\\r\\namong those countries most at risk from the adverse\\r\\neffects of climate change. Already, many of our islands\\r\\nare experiencing those effects in areas that impact\\r\\ndirectly on the important tourism sector of our\\r\\neconomies. We are also prone to extremely damaging\\r\\nnatural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm\\r\\nsurges, which visit us annually with increasing\\r\\nfrequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also\\r\\nexperiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions\\r\\nand earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if\\r\\nless regularly than the pleasantly named perennials.\\r\\nThe continued committed support of the international\\r\\ncommunity is crucial in complementing the work of\\r\\nthose States in addressing these serious problems.\\r\\nOur survival as a region is intimately interwoven\\r\\nwith our environment. Our physical and economic\\r\\nlimitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways.\\r\\nSuch actions are a flagrant violation of our human\\r\\nrights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We\\r\\ntherefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a\\r\\nnuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable\\r\\ndevelopment.\\r\\nIn closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in\\r\\nthis forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of\\r\\nthe Charter of the United Nations, through service to\\r\\nour country, to the Caribbean and to the international\\r\\ncommunity. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of\\r\\nthe Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable\\r\\nSir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an\\r\\nelected member of our legislature. He has seen our\\r\\ncountry through the stages of constitutional\\r\\ndevelopment from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime\\r\\nMinister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint\\r\\nVincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to\\r\\ncontemplate public life without him. His address at the\\r\\nMillennium Summit was his last to this body, for he\\r\\nhas decided to demit office as Prime Minister before\\r\\nthe twenty-first anniversary of our political\\r\\nindependence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell\\r\\nhas made us all proud by his long, dedicated and\\r\\nvisionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the\\r\\narea of land reform, which empowered people through\\r\\nland ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate\\r\\nthat, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend\\r\\nsincere gratitude to him from this rostrum.\\r\\nThe challenge is ours: to turn our words into\\r\\naction and to agree on a common vision of our future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   \n",
       "2  I convey to the\\r\\nPresident the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his\\r\\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth\\r\\nsession of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him\\r\\nSri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work.\\r\\nTo the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo-\\r\\nBen Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and\\r\\nadmiration for the masterly manner in which he served\\r\\nas President of the fifty-fourth session of the General\\r\\nAssembly.\\r\\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\\r\\nwelcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United\\r\\nNations.\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope\\r\\nthat its dreams and hopes for a better world will never\\r\\nfade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The\\r\\nPresident of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike\\r\\nKumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed,\\r\\n24\\r\\n\\r\\nthrough a message I had the honour to read out to the\\r\\nSummit, her hopes and her vision for the future of\\r\\nhumanity. Her words were these:\\r\\n“Peace among all States and peace among\\r\\nall peoples within States so that all, and not only\\r\\nsome, may in safety, without fear, in dignity,\\r\\nwithout humiliation, in good health, and in\\r\\nmaterial and spiritual well-being enjoy the\\r\\nwonders of life on this miracle we call the planet\\r\\nEarth.” (A/55/PV.7)\\r\\nTherefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with\\r\\nemphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving,\\r\\nfor the future, those minimal and most fundamental\\r\\ncertainties that the Member States of the United\\r\\nNations have been able to establish — in particular, to\\r\\npreserve what was and continues to be the\\r\\nOrganization's very foundation: the entity we know as\\r\\nthe State. She pointed out that it was in the General\\r\\nAssembly that representatives of Governments, of\\r\\npeoples and of States gather together under a Charter\\r\\nthat assures States of their sovereign equality, their\\r\\npolitical independence and their territorial integrity.\\r\\nThese are the fundamentals of the United Nations\\r\\nsystem.\\r\\nAnd this is as it should be. States are the principal\\r\\norganizational entities into which the peoples of this\\r\\nplanet have gathered. The principal, overall\\r\\norganizational edifice of the international community is\\r\\nthe inter-States system.\\r\\nFor the entity we know as the State, there is no\\r\\nsubstitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization.\\r\\nIf States are diminished, so will this Organization be\\r\\ndiminished.\\r\\nThus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka\\r\\nthat everything possible be done to protect and\\r\\npreserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the\\r\\nstability and the well-being of the entity we know as\\r\\nthe State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity\\r\\nand political independence the Charter gave us its\\r\\nassurance.\\r\\nBefore proceeding any further I should make it\\r\\nclear — in view of recent statements on the part of\\r\\nspeakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with\\r\\nwhose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ —\\r\\nthat those who assert the necessity of continued\\r\\nreaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of\\r\\nthe Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not\\r\\nbe regarded — as having in any way diminished their\\r\\ncommitment to the importance of universal adherence\\r\\nto human rights and all that is required for the dignity\\r\\nof the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the\\r\\npromotion and protection of the human rights of its\\r\\nown people and of all peoples everywhere.\\r\\nThere is, however, a substantial body of opinion,\\r\\nwithin which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the\\r\\nview that the way to proceed in the matter of human\\r\\nrights and the dignity of the individual is properly\\r\\nthrough continued and close cooperation between all\\r\\nStates, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The\\r\\nway of multilateralism or globalization, which appear\\r\\nexpressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the\\r\\nsovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall,\\r\\na commendable course. It is not a course whose\\r\\nworthiness in practice has as yet been established.\\r\\nIndeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the\\r\\nsovereignty of States have often had disastrous\\r\\nconsequences. With that initial clarification and a\\r\\nreminder that human rights are for the observance not\\r\\nonly of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall\\r\\nproceed with the remainder of my address.\\r\\nWe must bear in mind that the entities we know\\r\\nas States are national and international corporate\\r\\nentities of enormous complexity, differing in so many\\r\\nrespects from corporate entities of the private sector\\r\\nand, of course, differing as well from those\\r\\ninnumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which\\r\\nwe refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat\\r\\nsimplistically, as civil society.\\r\\nIf the management of a developed State with\\r\\nmore than adequate resources at its command is a\\r\\ncomplex undertaking, how much more complex would\\r\\nbe the management of a developing State without such\\r\\nresources and such infrastructures? Then there are\\r\\nthose developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their\\r\\nmulti-ethnic, multireligious societies where the\\r\\nlegacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than\\r\\none generation to erase.\\r\\nAside from the pressures inherent in the very\\r\\nnature and history of a State, let us not forget the\\r\\nadditional external pressures a State is subject to —\\r\\neconomic, social and political, legitimate and\\r\\nillegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal —\\r\\nthat the age of information and its consequences have\\r\\nbrought in their wake. These are external pressures that\\r\\nraise troubling uncertainties for many States and for\\r\\n25\\r\\n\\r\\ndeveloping States in particular, that are without the\\r\\nblessings of abundant resources and advanced\\r\\ninfrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the\\r\\nstructures of States and could come close to threatening\\r\\ntheir very existence.\\r\\nWhere the processes of globalization are\\r\\nexploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the\\r\\nillegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the\\r\\nreport from the Secretariat received by this Assembly\\r\\nthree years ago which drew attention to the threat to\\r\\nGovernment authority and civil society, to law and\\r\\norder and to legitimate economic and political\\r\\ninstitutions posed by transnational networks of crime,\\r\\nnarcotics, money laundering and terrorism having\\r\\naccess to sophisticated information technologies and\\r\\nweaponry.\\r\\nOf course, where there is the use of internal\\r\\narmed force against a State, as in my country, the\\r\\ncomplexities within a State compound themselves\\r\\nmany times over; and we know that the use of armed\\r\\nforce against a State is the greatest threat of all to its\\r\\npreservation and well-being. This is particularly so in\\r\\ndemocracies, whose very openness makes them most\\r\\nvulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long-\\r\\nstanding and unwavering commitment to democratic\\r\\nfundamentals.\\r\\nPeace among States, the primary purpose of the\\r\\nCharter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in\\r\\nfact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of\\r\\ngenerally observed rules of international law, under and\\r\\npursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of\\r\\narmed force by one State against another State, except\\r\\nin self-defence or as authorized by the Security\\r\\nCouncil.\\r\\nYet when we turn to peace within States, and the\\r\\nuse of armed force against a State internally, we see an\\r\\nentirely different, and an often confusing and\\r\\nfrustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each\\r\\na creature of its own history; the nature of each\\r\\ndetermined by its own surroundings. There is no\\r\\nsimplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario,\\r\\nno easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in\\r\\nmany different forms.\\r\\nThe relatively clear-cut format of a United\\r\\nNations response to inter-State armed conflicts —\\r\\nmonitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an\\r\\nagreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal\\r\\narmed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable.\\r\\nThe Charter does not prescribe how this\\r\\nOrganization should proceed in cases of internal armed\\r\\nconflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2,\\r\\nparagraph 7, which says,\\r\\n“Nothing contained in the present Charter\\r\\nshall authorize the United Nations to intervene in\\r\\nmatters which are essentially within the domestic\\r\\njurisdiction of any State.”\\r\\nIn view of the varieties, complexities and\\r\\nintricacies of internal armed conflicts, this\\r\\nOrganization appears to be without the necessary\\r\\nstructure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and\\r\\nresources — and often, it would seem — without the\\r\\nnecessary collective will.\\r\\nTo suggest that the United Nations should\\r\\nintervene in internal armed conflicts across the\\r\\nboard — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of\\r\\nobvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local\\r\\ncircumstances — is wishful thinking of the most\\r\\nsimplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme.\\r\\nA proposition of such a nature ignores the\\r\\nfundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so\\r\\nimpressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of\\r\\nState of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his\\r\\nsummation of the deliberations of round table four: that\\r\\na democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental\\r\\nnecessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political\\r\\nprocesses, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the\\r\\ndemocratically expressed will of the populace of a\\r\\nState, which an armed terroristic attack on a\\r\\ndemocratic State so obviously constitutes.\\r\\nAt a more practical level, where would this\\r\\nOrganization — woefully under-financed for the\\r\\nfulfilment of its development objectives, which billions\\r\\naround this world expectantly await — obtain the\\r\\nfurther resources for such far-flung interventions in\\r\\ninternal domestic crises.\\r\\nCharter provisions and United Nations practice\\r\\naffirm that a State may act in individual or collective\\r\\nself-defence should there be an armed attack across its\\r\\nfrontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack,\\r\\nthe abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of\\r\\nmost developing States — to react with equivalent\\r\\narmed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the\\r\\nlaw of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order,\\r\\nare very limited. Traditional police services are\\r\\ninadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in\\r\\n26\\r\\n\\r\\nexperience. Few States have ready and affordable\\r\\naccess to the necessary information or intelligence.\\r\\nFew States are able to maintain military infrastructures\\r\\neffective against heavily armed guerrilla-type\\r\\nonslaughts and the horrors of terror.\\r\\nSuch has been the experience of my country. Sri\\r\\nLanka has for many years had within its territory an\\r\\narmed conflict that has complicated the lives of the\\r\\nentire population of the country. It is a conflict of an\\r\\nextraordinary nature. A very small group of armed\\r\\nfighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000\\r\\npersons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to\\r\\nviolence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society\\r\\nand participatory governance; achieving, through the\\r\\npractice of systematic terror, national and international\\r\\nnotoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such\\r\\nproblems as they may have through dialogue —\\r\\ncontinues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion\\r\\nagainst the State to fight for the establishment of a\\r\\nseparate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our\\r\\nterritory.\\r\\nA democratic State, because of its openness, its\\r\\nlaws, traditions and practices and its commitment to\\r\\ntolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the\\r\\ndeployment of force against it by any group within its\\r\\nboundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State\\r\\nanywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere.\\r\\nUnless all States, democratic States in particular, agree\\r\\nto come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy\\r\\nitself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will\\r\\nnot survive.\\r\\nWhen the security and integrity of one State is\\r\\nthreatened by an armed group within it, surely —\\r\\nespecially in these contemporary times, with the cold\\r\\nwar far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny\\r\\nthat armed group any encouragement, any succour, any\\r\\nsafe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist\\r\\nactivities in one country, massive funds are raised with\\r\\nimpunity in other countries, often through knowing or\\r\\nunknowing front organizations or other entities that\\r\\nnow proliferate in many forms and in many countries,\\r\\nand often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or\\r\\ngroups ostensibly concerned with human rights or\\r\\nethnic, cultural or social matters.\\r\\nThe magnitude of the collection of funds abroad\\r\\nfor terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the\\r\\nreach of the international networks developed for that\\r\\npurpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to\\r\\nexceed the receipts of many transnational\\r\\nconglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of\\r\\ncourse, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms\\r\\nor other merchandise, including the smuggling of\\r\\nhumans.\\r\\nBut there also exists a far more abundant and\\r\\nseemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely,\\r\\nexpatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the\\r\\nwestern media has reported over the past few years\\r\\nfrom time to time, collections from expatriates abroad\\r\\nfor the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which\\r\\nis battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering\\r\\nin their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month\\r\\nfrom one country; $600,000 a month from another;\\r\\n$2.7 million a month from yet another; and large\\r\\nadditional funds from expatriates in still other\\r\\ncountries.\\r\\nIn 1988 an excellent study was published on\\r\\nfinancial havens, banking secrecy and money\\r\\nlaundering, a study by experts in the field,\\r\\ncommissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug\\r\\nControl and Crime Prevention. In order to implement\\r\\nadequately the provisions of the recently adopted\\r\\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\\r\\nFinancing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by\\r\\nUnited Nations bodies on the collection of external\\r\\nfunds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion\\r\\nagainst a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes\\r\\nespecially necessary when the armed group battling a\\r\\nState is in blatant violation of the human rights and\\r\\nhumanitarian norms and standards — including those\\r\\nrelating to children and to children in armed conflict —\\r\\nthat this Organization so correctly and so diligently\\r\\nespouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in\\r\\nhuman society.\\r\\nI proposed such a study at the fourth round table\\r\\nof the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was\\r\\nendorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of\\r\\nAlgeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of\\r\\nthe proceedings of our round table. I urge that the\\r\\ninternational community give favourable consideration\\r\\nto that proposal.\\r\\nAs the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled\\r\\nby such massive funds from abroad continues within a\\r\\nState, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to\\r\\nblur, not only among those in civil society, who are\\r\\noften uninformed, but even on the part of those in\\r\\npositions of international authority, within and outside\\r\\n27\\r\\n\\r\\nthis Organization, who should know better. The\\r\\nexistence of the internal armed conflict and the\\r\\nresulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of\\r\\nhostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention\\r\\nto the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal\\r\\ngroup that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the\\r\\nvictim.\\r\\nSuch a blurring of international perceptions in\\r\\nsome quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is\\r\\ndistressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those,\\r\\nsuch as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and\\r\\ncontinue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic\\r\\nway of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic,\\r\\nmultireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we\\r\\nwere once so blessed to enjoy.\\r\\nI hope that the thoughts that I have expressed\\r\\ntoday on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the\\r\\naffairs of developing States in the main, will show in\\r\\nsome measure why a sympathetic, rather than an\\r\\ninquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the\\r\\naffairs of States, as in all human relationships.\\r\\nAt a more general level, I would like, before I\\r\\nmove on from this part of my statement, to refer to two\\r\\nother relevant questions: the role of the General\\r\\nAssembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of\\r\\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the only\\r\\nprincipal organ of the United Nations in which all\\r\\nMember States are represented, and the only principal\\r\\norgan whose terms of reference allow for consideration\\r\\nof any matter within the scope of the Charter.\\r\\nYet there is the perception among some that the\\r\\ncentre of gravity in decision-making on questions of\\r\\nmajor policy importance to the Organization appears to\\r\\nhave moved away from the General Assembly to an\\r\\nextent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly\\r\\nwelcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30\\r\\nof the Millennium Declaration of the central position of\\r\\nthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-\\r\\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations,\\r\\nand the commitment of all nations to enable the\\r\\nGeneral Assembly to play that role effectively. The\\r\\npractical manner in which the General Assembly could\\r\\nplay that role will, of course, require very careful\\r\\nthought.\\r\\nThe ways in which “civil society”, and the\\r\\ninnumerable entities that that expression encompasses,\\r\\ncould best contribute to the work of the United\\r\\nNations — in terms of data collection, research and\\r\\nanalysis and expertise — in a manner that does not\\r\\nprejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United\\r\\nNations, will also require most careful examination.\\r\\nSuch contributions should be made in a manner that is\\r\\nnot partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but,\\r\\nrather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral\\r\\nconsultant.\\r\\nMoreover, although civil society within a national\\r\\ncontext could be, and is, well accommodated in\\r\\ndomestic political processes, the manner in which civil\\r\\nsociety could be internationally accommodated within\\r\\nUnited Nations processes still remains a puzzle.\\r\\nAs in all human relationships, so also amongst\\r\\nStates: the strong do better than the weak, the rich\\r\\nbetter than the poor, the developed better than the\\r\\ndeveloping. This is the case most of all when times are\\r\\nhard. The marked decline in official development\\r\\nassistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the\\r\\nrich and the developed to meet their official\\r\\ndevelopment assistance pledges, show that for States,\\r\\nthere is no general safety net.\\r\\nIf there is one message from the Millennium\\r\\nSummit, and one that is now coming from this\\r\\nMillennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that\\r\\nglobalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that\\r\\nno panacea for all — certainly not for the developing\\r\\nworld. The benefits of globalization have by-passed\\r\\nmuch of the developing world. The poorest among us,\\r\\nspanning the continents of Africa, Central America and\\r\\nAsia, have experienced increasing marginalization.\\r\\nThere is little opportunity for developing countries to\\r\\nbe formative in the shaping of the world economy for\\r\\nthe future — in the deliberations that really matter.\\r\\nThus, although we are leaving the past century\\r\\nand the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their\\r\\npassing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by\\r\\nthe old, intractable economic and social tragedies that\\r\\nhave been with us since the dawn of time: poverty,\\r\\nilliteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the\\r\\nproblems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and\\r\\nthe growth of mega-cities.\\r\\nAmong these, poverty alleviation and poverty\\r\\nelimination remain for most of us in the developing\\r\\nworld the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful\\r\\npriority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of\\r\\nabundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in\\r\\nreal time across billions of television screens\\r\\nthroughout the world, undermines the very foundations\\r\\n28\\r\\n\\r\\nnecessary for the growth of humane societies and\\r\\nrefined governance.\\r\\nThe developing world needs to be accorded an\\r\\nadequate formative voice in the formulation of a new\\r\\ndevelopment chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus\\r\\nwe turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse,\\r\\nas it were, to this General Assembly, under whose\\r\\nactive supervisory authority there must be a revival of\\r\\na comprehensive North-South development dialogue —\\r\\na dialogue that seems to be fading away.\\r\\nTo tell the countless starving and helpless\\r\\nmillions that a free global marketplace will show us the\\r\\nway is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough.\\r\\nResource deprivation over many generations and\\r\\nits debilitating consequences on adequate\\r\\ninfrastructural growth has severely damaged the\\r\\ncapacity of developing countries to cope with the\\r\\nmodern world.\\r\\nA new development chapter must provide for the\\r\\ncatastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man-\\r\\nmade” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the\\r\\npresent surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in\\r\\na decade that now place crushing burdens on the\\r\\nnational economies of developing countries struggling\\r\\ndesperately to contend with economic realities. They,\\r\\nlike Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil-\\r\\nproducing countries, which are certainly not insensitive\\r\\nto the plight of the developing world, will find it\\r\\npossible in some way to relieve such pressures in the\\r\\nvery near future.\\r\\nI should also wish at this juncture in my address\\r\\nto say a word about the South Asian Association for\\r\\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of\\r\\nSouth Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,\\r\\nNepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is\\r\\ndeeply committed to the advancement of the economic\\r\\nand social well-being of our peoples, numbering now\\r\\nin the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through\\r\\nnational endeavour, but through regional and\\r\\ninternational cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current\\r\\nChair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the\\r\\nprogramme of activities laid down at the 1991\\r\\nColombo summit as best it can in difficult\\r\\ncircumstances. The people of our region are deeply\\r\\ncommitted to the goals of SAARC. They continue to\\r\\ninteract vigorously on a wide range of professional,\\r\\ncultural, educational and social activities,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level\\r\\npolitical involvement that SAARC has suffered at this\\r\\ntime. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be\\r\\nlong before our movement is again able to play its full\\r\\nrole in the welfare of our peoples.\\r\\nI have just returned to New York from the\\r\\nInternational Conference on War-Affected Children,\\r\\norganized so successfully by the Government of\\r\\nCanada and held at Winnipeg.\\r\\nI cannot conclude my address to the General\\r\\nAssembly this year without making at least a brief\\r\\nreference to the abominable crimes that are being\\r\\ncommitted against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka\\r\\nby the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They\\r\\nhave been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year-\\r\\nold children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri\\r\\nLankan Army. Some of these children have been\\r\\nprogrammed into suicide bombers. They are forced to\\r\\nwear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on\\r\\nthem to evade capture. This wretched practice\\r\\ncontinues unabated.\\r\\nIn 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the\\r\\nSecretary-General's Special Representative for\\r\\nChildren and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu,\\r\\nvisited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger\\r\\nleaders. They assured him that they would not recruit\\r\\nany person under the age of 17 and would not send into\\r\\nbattle any person below the age of 18. A few months\\r\\nago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have\\r\\nbeen continuous reports of the recruitment and the use\\r\\nof children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they\\r\\ngave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant\\r\\nanswer to a question by an interviewer, the Special\\r\\nRepresentative said this:\\r\\n“Children who become soldiers lose their\\r\\ninnocence. Part of the reason why the fighting\\r\\ngroups will tend to reach out to children is\\r\\nbecause, of course, the adults may become\\r\\ndisillusioned, they may be killed off, they may\\r\\nrun away, so they reach the children who are less\\r\\nable to defend themselves. But there's a more\\r\\ncynical reason than that: children, because they\\r\\nare innocent, can be moulded into the most\\r\\nunquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into\\r\\nsuicide commandos, into committing the worst\\r\\natrocities. In other situations, it is ideology —\\r\\ncome fight for the homeland, come fight for our\\r\\nethnic group, come fight for a new society — that\\r\\nmay appeal to families and to children. So there\\r\\n29\\r\\n\\r\\nare many reasons which facilitate the abuse of\\r\\nchildren in this way.”\\r\\nI thank the Special Representative for having had\\r\\nthe courage to speak out on this important issue. To\\r\\nremain silent in the face of such criminality is to\\r\\nencourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us\\r\\nwho care about the children of the world to rally\\r\\nagainst the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm\\r\\ncynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one\\r\\nthat abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the\\r\\nrepresentative of the United Nations Children's Fund in\\r\\nSri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his\\r\\nstatement — that the situation of children in the areas\\r\\nheld by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave\\r\\ntheir assurance to the United Nations Special\\r\\nRepresentative. Parents have reported that their\\r\\nchildren have been recruited. It is a serious problem.\\r\\nHe observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of\\r\\nTamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people\\r\\nthat they have taken measures to prevent children\\r\\nbelow 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take\\r\\ntheir promises seriously.\\r\\nA respected and courageous human rights group\\r\\nin Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who\\r\\nused to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent\\r\\nreport that since last May a fresh child-recruitment\\r\\ncampaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers.\\r\\nAccording to their report, children as young as 10 years\\r\\nare being forcibly conscripted, age being no\\r\\nconsideration as long as the child was able to carry a\\r\\ngun. In recent days and months the international press\\r\\nhas focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in\\r\\nSri Lanka.\\r\\nA few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its\\r\\ninstrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on\\r\\nthe Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the\\r\\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol\\r\\nhas noted that the Statute of the International Criminal\\r\\nCourt makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in\\r\\ncombat a war crime in both international and non-\\r\\ninternational armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors\\r\\nalso accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State\\r\\nparties to cooperate in preventing and combating such\\r\\ncrimes.\\r\\nAccordingly, today, in this General Assembly of\\r\\nthe United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to\\r\\nratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties\\r\\non whose territory the LTTE has offices and front\\r\\norganizations to take strong punitive action against\\r\\nsuch establishments, and to declare the LTTE a\\r\\ncriminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal\\r\\nactivity in respect of the use of child soldiers through\\r\\nfunds generated on the territories of other State parties,\\r\\nwhich are obliged to cooperate in terms of the\\r\\nConvention and the Protocol.\\r\\nThe Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with\\r\\nan impassioned plea to the world to move urgently\\r\\nfrom words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands\\r\\nof children who are abused, maimed, displaced,\\r\\ntraumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if\\r\\nanything should stir the conscience of mankind it is\\r\\nsurely the plight of these children. Let it not be said\\r\\nthat yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed\\r\\nthe anguished cry of children in distress, children on\\r\\nwhom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict,\\r\\nunspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on\\r\\nthe issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not\\r\\nrequired to save them. What is required is the will and\\r\\nthe commitment to act of those States which are in a\\r\\nposition to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to\\r\\nthem. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal\\r\\nnow so that when the special session of the General\\r\\nAssembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for\\r\\nChildren is held here in New York next September, we\\r\\nwill be able to adopt practical measures that will finally\\r\\nensure that children will be forever protected from the\\r\\nravages of war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Allow me, Sir, at the\\r\\noutset to congratulate you heartily on your election to\\r\\nthe Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a\\r\\nclose friend and partner within the Nordic community.\\r\\nWe wish you success with this challenging task and\\r\\npledge to you the full support of the Icelandic\\r\\ndelegation.\\r\\nThe Millennium Declaration provides the\\r\\ncommitments of the world community in the new\\r\\ncentury. To prevent conflicts, maintain international\\r\\npeace and security and make peace an achievable goal\\r\\nat the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue\\r\\nstrengthening the United Nations and the international\\r\\nlegal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported\\r\\nverifiable arms control and arms reduction measures\\r\\nand will continue to support realistic disarmament\\r\\nproposals aiming at maximum security with a\\r\\nminimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the\\r\\nenormous sums being spent on weapons, while the\\r\\nmoney could be used to significantly improve the lives\\r\\nof millions.\\r\\nToday, when there is an obvious need to assess\\r\\nthe United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping\\r\\noperations, it has proved extremely important to have a\\r\\nSecretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of\\r\\nthe matter through his own experience. I would like to\\r\\ncommend the Secretary-General for taking the\\r\\ninitiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the\\r\\nfield to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi\\r\\nreport. Its recommendations should be implemented as\\r\\nsoon as possible.\\r\\nEven though my country does not have a military,\\r\\nit has been able to participate in peacekeeping\\r\\noperations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing\\r\\nmedical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of\\r\\nlaw, the media and women's rights. We have noted with\\r\\ninterest the recommendations made in the Brahimi\\r\\nreport concerning the non-military aspects of peace\\r\\noperations. We will be studying them carefully now\\r\\nthat we are in the process of looking into how we can\\r\\nstrengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the\\r\\nfuture.\\r\\nThe report states that expressions of general\\r\\nsupport in the form of statements and resolutions must\\r\\nbe followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking\\r\\nthese words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making.\\r\\nIn the preparations for the Millennium Assembly,\\r\\nthe Secretary-General encouraged Member States to\\r\\nengage more effectively in the international legal\\r\\nframework by acceding to a number of legal\\r\\ninstruments. One to which Iceland has decided to\\r\\naccede is the Convention on the Safety of United\\r\\nNations and Associated Personnel.\\r\\nThe Security Council has the primary\\r\\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\\r\\npeace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded\\r\\nin reflecting the tremendous changes in the\\r\\ninternational arena which have taken place since its\\r\\nestablishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years\\r\\nto come, the reform process has to be accelerated.\\r\\nThe rules of international law governing the\\r\\nrelations between States are now well established; this\\r\\nalso applies in the fields of human rights and\\r\\nhumanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and\\r\\nobligations of States and individuals. But ground rules\\r\\ndo not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them.\\r\\nThere are mechanisms to ensure respect and\\r\\ncompliance with these rules, such as the General\\r\\nAssembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping\\r\\nmissions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an\\r\\neffective international court system should be available\\r\\nto bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the\\r\\nsame time serving to deter potential perpetrators.\\r\\nWith this in mind, I believe that the greatest\\r\\nachievements towards strengthening the international\\r\\nlegal system in recent years have been the\\r\\nestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunals\\r\\nfor the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda\\r\\nand the adoption of the Rome Statute of the\\r\\nInternational Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the\\r\\nRome Statute and encourages all other States to do so.\\r\\nI welcome the proposal to include cooperation\\r\\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe\\r\\nin the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I\\r\\nhad the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of\\r\\nthe Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well\\r\\naware of the important contribution made by the\\r\\nCouncil to peace and stability in Europe, especially in\\r\\nthe field of human rights. The United Nations, the\\r\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\\r\\n(OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\\r\\n(NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations\\r\\n14\\r\\n\\r\\nresponded to the serious situation in the Balkans by\\r\\njoining forces and working together to make\\r\\nreconstruction achievable.\\r\\nIn Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter-\\r\\nethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements\\r\\ncannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by\\r\\nthe international community. One ethnic group must\\r\\nnot be allowed to win at the expense of another. The\\r\\nKosovars have been provided with a unique\\r\\nopportunity to build a just community in the region —\\r\\na community where the fundamental freedoms and\\r\\nrights of every individual and minority group are\\r\\nrespected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are\\r\\nKosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation\\r\\nfor lasting peace and stability for future generations.\\r\\nThe same can be said about similar situations\\r\\nelsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and\\r\\nHerzegovina.\\r\\nThe international community has taken on an\\r\\nenormous task in building a whole new civic structure\\r\\nwithin Kosovo. The development of a legal system and\\r\\nfree media have been two challenging tasks. The\\r\\nelections to take place in October are also going to be\\r\\nchallenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an\\r\\norderly and peaceful manner.\\r\\nIt is very important to include women in the\\r\\npolitical process. In this respect, I would like to\\r\\ncommend the United Nations Development Fund for\\r\\nWomen (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in\\r\\nKosovo, not only in the political field but also in\\r\\nfighting violence against women and in promoting\\r\\nwomen's participation in economic activities.\\r\\nThe importance of human rights in securing long-\\r\\nterm stability and security, both within and between\\r\\ncountries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore\\r\\nessential that no compromises be accepted in this field,\\r\\nand our aims should remain high.\\r\\nThe Security Council should be commended for\\r\\ndiscussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security\\r\\nthreat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in\\r\\nsub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of\\r\\nchildren and armed conflict. The discussion in the\\r\\nCouncil has served to concentrate the attention of the\\r\\ninternational community on these issues and led the\\r\\nway for others to take the measures required. Both\\r\\nissues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect\\r\\nthem to feature prominently on the agenda of next\\r\\nyear's special session to follow up the World Summit\\r\\nfor Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a\\r\\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the\\r\\nenormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international\\r\\nefforts to combat it.\\r\\nThe rights of women were significantly enhanced\\r\\nwith the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to\\r\\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\\r\\nDiscrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the\\r\\nProtocol and is preparing its ratification.\\r\\nI cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of\\r\\nthose women around the world who are still enduring\\r\\nmajor human rights abuses, including female genital\\r\\nmutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions\\r\\non their freedom of movement and the right to work.\\r\\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the Prime\\r\\nMinister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols\\r\\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland\\r\\nwelcomes their adoption and hopes that they will\\r\\nfurther secure the human rights of children.\\r\\nWe have to put extra effort into working towards\\r\\nthe elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying\\r\\nto note the trend towards increasing racism and\\r\\nxenophobia in certain parts of the world, including\\r\\nEurope. This needs to be fought at all levels. The\\r\\nWorld Conference to be held in South Africa next year\\r\\nwill without doubt play an important role. Iceland\\r\\nwelcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of\\r\\nhistory, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it.\\r\\nAs reflected in the report of the Secretary-\\r\\nGeneral, “We the peoples”, fighting poverty remains\\r\\none of the main challenges to the United Nations.\\r\\nPeople living in poverty do not have the opportunity to\\r\\nexercise many of their fundamental rights and\\r\\nfreedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of\\r\\nglobalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as\\r\\ndecided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to\\r\\nbe done. Globalization and new technologies offer\\r\\nmany opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate\\r\\nthan in the past.\\r\\nWe have been strengthening our development\\r\\ncooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the\\r\\nbilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of\\r\\nAfrican countries with a focus on strengthening their\\r\\nfishing industry and education and health areas, with\\r\\nthe potential to positively alter the lives of people in\\r\\nneed. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing\\r\\nto the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\nthrough the World Bank and the International Monetary\\r\\nFund.\\r\\nMost of our decisions are based on compromises,\\r\\nin which each and every one of us has to give a little in\\r\\norder to reach an agreement. It is very important to\\r\\nkeep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance,\\r\\nbut also when the time comes for us to pay our dues,\\r\\nboth to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping\\r\\nbudget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this\\r\\nOrganization that all Members pay their contributions\\r\\nfully, on time and without any conditions.\\r\\nIn recent years, the oceans of the world have\\r\\nreceived increased attention in the General Assembly.\\r\\nWe welcome this development. Iceland's economy is\\r\\nbased on the sustainable harvest of living marine\\r\\nresources. The health and responsible stewardship of\\r\\nthe oceans are therefore of critical importance to us.\\r\\nLast year, we resolved to improve United Nations\\r\\ncoordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that\\r\\nend, we established an Informal Consultative Process\\r\\nto discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceans\\r\\nand the law of the sea. I was pleased with the\\r\\nimplementation of this decision of the first Meeting of\\r\\nthis Process last spring.\\r\\nHowever, we must act carefully when seeking to\\r\\nimprove our coordination and cooperation in this area.\\r\\nOcean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level\\r\\nand be consistent with the rights and obligations laid\\r\\ndown in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We\\r\\nmust fully respect the sovereign right of States over\\r\\ntheir natural resources and the competence of existing\\r\\ninternational organizations. Above all, the integrity of\\r\\nthe Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful\\r\\nthat the Convention provides the legal framework\\r\\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must\\r\\nbe carried out.\\r\\nThe United Nations specialized agencies have an\\r\\nimportant role to play in promoting the conservation\\r\\nand sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this\\r\\nrespect is marine scientific research. We need more\\r\\naccurate and policy-oriented information on the state of\\r\\nthe oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a\\r\\nworthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process\\r\\non Ocean Affairs.\\r\\nAt the onset of a new millennium, it is more\\r\\npressing than ever before to ensure the access of people\\r\\nin the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to\\r\\nreadily available and sustainable energy. Today, about\\r\\none third of the world's population does not have such\\r\\naccess, and this situation is obviously a serious\\r\\nobstacle to the development of these communities. In\\r\\nmy country, we have been able to bring sustainable\\r\\nenergy to all households in the country. We are sharing\\r\\nour experience and knowledge with the developing\\r\\ncountries through the United Nations University\\r\\nGeothermal Training Programme, which is located in\\r\\nIceland and funded by my Government.\\r\\nThe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a\\r\\nmomentum for building a secure future for humankind\\r\\nand life on Earth under the banner of sustainable\\r\\ndevelopment. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a\\r\\nglobal conference to take stock of the progress made in\\r\\nmeeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and\\r\\nthe other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have\\r\\nnot been able to live up to all the expectations raised in\\r\\nRio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the\\r\\nprogress that we have made.\\r\\nThe concept of sustainable development has truly\\r\\nbecome accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in\\r\\nenvironmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own\\r\\ncountry, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe\\r\\nthat we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use\\r\\nregime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy\\r\\necosystem and a robust economy. Regional and\\r\\ninternational efforts to prevent the pollution of the\\r\\noceans have continued to gather strength and we can\\r\\nexpect further efforts, in particular to control pollution\\r\\nfrom land-based sources.\\r\\nIt is my belief that, in charting a course for the\\r\\nfuture, we should be looking at success stories and\\r\\nlearning from them, rather than concentrating on the\\r\\nobstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but\\r\\nnot the doom-sayers.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “We, the\\r\\npeoples” is a powerful rendition of world affairs and a\\r\\ndaunting portrait of life for future generations. It took\\r\\nintellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex\\r\\ncase in such a concise and forceful way. We are\\r\\ngrateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for\\r\\nproducing it.\\r\\n“We, the peoples” are of course the opening\\r\\nwords of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point\\r\\nof departure. Other speakers have done so before me\\r\\nand have argued in favour of a more robust structure\\r\\nfor keeping the peace in the world community. They\\r\\nare right. The United Nations role in the area of\\r\\npreventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as\\r\\nits principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown\\r\\nhow, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping\\r\\nfunction has in fact become its Achilles heel. The\\r\\nBrahimi recommendations deserve to be\\r\\nimplemented — the sooner the better. At present, the\\r\\nNetherlands Government and parliament are debating\\r\\nhow to improve our national contribution to\\r\\npeacekeeping.\\r\\n15\\r\\n\\r\\n“We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a\\r\\ntotally different side of the United Nations reality as\\r\\nwell. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in\\r\\nfavour of closer ties between the United Nations and\\r\\nthe private sector.\\r\\nIn 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter\\r\\nhinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of\\r\\nlife as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and\\r\\nsecurity to social justice, from economic cooperation to\\r\\nhuman rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly\\r\\nmentions any other actors besides States. Non-\\r\\ngovernmental organizations appear in the Charter only\\r\\nonce. The private sector is not referred to at all. In\\r\\nother words, the Charter conforms to a model of\\r\\ngovernance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state\\r\\nsystem going back to the mid-1600s.\\r\\nIn order to strategize for the future, we need to\\r\\nask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world\\r\\ntoday; where and how are world affairs conducted; and\\r\\nhow can we position the United Nations accordingly?\\r\\nThe United Nations is made up of Member States.\\r\\nThat is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians\\r\\nof foreign relations for a long time to come. But their\\r\\nroles have changed significantly with time. States can\\r\\nno longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of\\r\\ninternational relations. Internationalization has altered\\r\\nthe concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous\\r\\nentities as before, pursuing self-defined national\\r\\ninterests. Their actions are now much more shaped by\\r\\neconomic pressures, information flows, and population\\r\\nmovements. For States, too, globalization is here to\\r\\nstay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and\\r\\ninternational scenes. Civil society is one. The private\\r\\nsector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of\\r\\nnon-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide\\r\\nspectrum, beyond any expectation of the United\\r\\nNations founding fathers. Many non-governmental\\r\\norganizations operate across national boundaries. At\\r\\nthe present time, the United Nations system could\\r\\nnever hope to operate properly without the assistance\\r\\nof non-governmental organizations, not to mention\\r\\nnormative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental\\r\\norganizations have acquired access to the United\\r\\nNations at different levels, and participate in many of\\r\\nits discussions.\\r\\nAlthough a potent actor on the domestic and\\r\\ninternational levels, the private sector has been\\r\\nvirtually ignored by traditional United Nations\\r\\ndiplomacy. The business community, and notably\\r\\ntransnational corporations, were viewed by many as the\\r\\ncompetitor, if not as the enemy of international public\\r\\ninterest. Documents critical of multinationals were\\r\\nbeing issued by the United Nations and the specialized\\r\\nagencies until recently. Confrontation rather than\\r\\ndialogue. I am not contending that there were no\\r\\ngrounds for that position: quite the contrary. However,\\r\\nnowadays we see a growing awareness in the business\\r\\ncommunity of the necessity of responsible corporate\\r\\npolicies and of a role for private enterprise in the\\r\\npursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing\\r\\nimmediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global\\r\\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the\\r\\npharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with\\r\\ninternational organizations, Governments and other\\r\\nactors.\\r\\nWe need to build on that. Indeed, the time has\\r\\ncome to expand the concept of a partnership with the\\r\\nprivate sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the\\r\\nworld is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the\\r\\nprivate sector does exist and wields a lot of power in\\r\\nthe international arena.\\r\\nAbout the odds: take a sustainable future, where\\r\\nelementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not\\r\\neven the most powerful Government can put a stop to\\r\\nglobal warming — nor all the Member States of the\\r\\nUnited Nations combined. A sustainable future needs\\r\\nto be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society\\r\\nand the scientific community. For equitable working\\r\\nconditions, and other forms of social justice, States\\r\\nneed to involve the private sector. The same is true for\\r\\nfighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting\\r\\nwater or AIDS.\\r\\nWe have truly entered an era that is very different\\r\\nfrom the one in which the United Nations was born —\\r\\nan era in which the course of humanity and the quality\\r\\nof life on earth have more and more become a shared\\r\\nresponsibility; an era where Governments, the private\\r\\nsector and civil society are drawn ever more closely\\r\\ntogether. They all have a stake in global governance.\\r\\nThe so-called global public goods are a matter for all of\\r\\nthem together.\\r\\nThe private sector has a stake in the future of the\\r\\nplanet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no\\r\\nplanet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own\\r\\ninterest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight\\r\\nin international relations and the influence they have at\\r\\n16\\r\\n\\r\\nthe domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want\\r\\na livable world for their grandchildren. The private\\r\\nsector must be called upon to enter into a responsible\\r\\ncorporate partnership in sync with other actors at the\\r\\ninternational plane. True, the role of each actor needs\\r\\nto be different. Their motivation can remain different,\\r\\ntoo — as does the legal basis on which they act. But\\r\\ntheir determination needs to be the same: the\\r\\ndetermination to secure the longevity of life as we\\r\\nknow it and to secure for everyone on the planet an\\r\\nequitable share of its bounty.\\r\\nDifferent roles, shared responsibility. That\\r\\nconcept needs to take root in this Organization as well.\\r\\nThe United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a\\r\\ngalvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the\\r\\ncoming century if it cannot show that its debates and\\r\\nits action platforms reflect the real world outside the\\r\\nconference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations\\r\\nas “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium\\r\\nreport puts it — it must be able to show that all players\\r\\nare on the stage.\\r\\nThe Secretary-General's Global Compact could\\r\\nnot have come at a more opportune moment. It is the\\r\\nmere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising\\r\\nstart. The Global Compact deserves the active support\\r\\nof the international community, and it deserves to be\\r\\njoined by other multinationals. I do understand the\\r\\ntrepidations of some non-governmental organizations\\r\\nwho fear that multinational corporations will drape\\r\\nthemselves in the United Nations flag and become\\r\\nuntouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too,\\r\\nthe apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who\\r\\nhave a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State\\r\\nand its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the\\r\\nGlobal Compact is not a Trojan horse.\\r\\nAnd I will go even further. We have given civil\\r\\nsociety structural access to the United Nations system.\\r\\nBy contrast, the access we are giving to the private\\r\\nsector, with the notable exception of the International\\r\\nLabour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural.\\r\\nIn the future, we must create appropriate channels of\\r\\ncommunication with the private sector, inside this\\r\\nOrganization, where they, as well as Governments and\\r\\ncivil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions\\r\\nof our time — a forum where, at the very least, they\\r\\ncan deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of\\r\\nmistrust that have divided them for so long.\\r\\nThat is the first reason why the United Nations\\r\\nneeds to broaden its scope and become more inclusive.\\r\\nThe second is the power of the private sector. Many\\r\\ncompanies have turnovers larger than the national\\r\\nbudgets of some Member States, and the same is true\\r\\nfor the personal fortunes of some chief executive\\r\\nofficers. The relationship between States and the\\r\\nprivate sector has altered dramatically over time. States\\r\\nwere once thought of as bulwarks against harmful\\r\\neconomic impact from abroad. Economic weight was\\r\\nviewed as a trump card in the power play among\\r\\nnations. Today, States are increasingly serving as\\r\\ninstruments for adjusting domestic policy to the\\r\\nrealities of the present-day world economy. They have\\r\\nbecome intermediaries between the world economy,\\r\\nwith its own structure of power, and domestic societies.\\r\\nThis brings up the question of where world affairs\\r\\nare being conducted and how they have caused a shift\\r\\nin the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has\\r\\nshifted the focus of attention to forums other than the\\r\\nUnited Nations here in New York, notably to the\\r\\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the\\r\\nWorld Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the\\r\\nEuropean Union. Policies are tested in the margins of\\r\\nthe World Economic Forum in Davos or decided\\r\\nelsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs.\\r\\nThat focus has brought on a different cast of players\\r\\nthan in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign\\r\\nMinisters now work shoulder to shoulder not only with\\r\\ndevelopment ministers, but also with finance and trade\\r\\nministers, as well as with central bankers. International\\r\\naffairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about\\r\\neconomics.\\r\\nForging a relationship with the private sector is\\r\\ntherefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to\\r\\npreserve its relevance over the long haul. The\\r\\nmultilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties\\r\\nwith other centres of power and with the business\\r\\ncommunity. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously\\r\\npursuing closer relations with all these various forums,\\r\\nand we encourage him to do more of the same.\\r\\nResponsible corporate partnership is also about\\r\\nprotecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not\\r\\nonly to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure\\r\\nfreedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages,\\r\\nglobalization is leaving too many victims by the\\r\\nwayside. The gap between the rich and the poor\\r\\ncontinues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in\\r\\nwar and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\na great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will\\r\\nbuy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly\\r\\non the quality of life in many developing countries.\\r\\nEven though the odds are staggering, the United\\r\\nNations system can make a difference in reducing\\r\\npoverty, gender inequality and child and maternal\\r\\nmortality. But it can make a difference only from a\\r\\nposition of strength and from a platform shared by\\r\\nother actors at the international level: from a position\\r\\nof shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has\\r\\ndeclared poverty eradication the United Nations\\r\\nnumber one priority. We applaud that. But fighting\\r\\npoverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has\\r\\nbeen; it has also become an economic one. That is\\r\\nanother reason for the United Nations to become more\\r\\ninclusive of the private sector.\\r\\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We\\r\\nthe peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take\\r\\nthe United Nations forward. Whatever the way\\r\\nforward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we\\r\\nhave been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we\\r\\nhave kept the United Nations on a very short leash,\\r\\nhardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of\\r\\nthe same is not enough. In other words, the United\\r\\nNations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples,\\r\\npursue our business as usual. The future will pass us\\r\\nby.\\r\\nThe alternative is an avenue that is much more\\r\\nambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations\\r\\nsystem as a vehicle for the development of a new\\r\\nvision of world politics, a vision for the “post-\\r\\nWestphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends\\r\\nwould be given legitimacy and a conceptual\\r\\nframework. In such a vision, the principle of non-\\r\\nintervention yields to the defence of human rights;\\r\\nsovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for\\r\\ncivil society and the private sector; and economics are\\r\\nalso held responsible for social and development goals.\\r\\nSuch is the road less travelled, but the only one that\\r\\ncan make all the difference.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   India congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the first General Assembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that he intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the mandate for the work of the Organization during his presidency. I take this opportunity to sincerely compliment and to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign Minister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his guidance of the General Assembly in the past year, which included three special sessions and, of course, meticulous preparations for and a successful conclusion to the Millennium Summit. I join India's voice to those of other delegations in noting with appreciation the dedication with which Secretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United Nations at a critical point. I am delighted on this occasion to warmly welcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United Nations. Just 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and Government assembled here for the Millennium Summit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as unique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium Declaration that was then adopted encapsulates a shared vision that the international community work together in constructive cooperation to meet collective challenges, within the framework of the United Nations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister spoke, as did many others, of the need for the United Nations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first century, to make it an effective instrument to translate 17  our vision into reality. The United Nations is the house that we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that it is equal to our collective expectations and our joint aspirations. Peace, collective security and development inspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the twenty-first century with extraordinary collective intellectual and technical capabilities. These are our global tools for overcoming the challenges before us. Peace and security for all is not just possible but is well within our grasp. Stability and development are the essential building blocks for the maintenance of peace and security. Threats to peace can and do arise from different sources. It is not just weapons of mass destruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but also dehumanizing poverty and lack of development. We must act as confident nation States committed to collective action and international cooperation, for these are our means to provide wider effects of peace and progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must abjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances warrant action by the Security Council, that action must be firmly rooted in Charter provisions. The Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of proposals. We recommend that the General Assembly examine this important report carefully and take appropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United Nations function of peacekeeping. We support the Middle East peace process and find the trend encouraging. The historic summit between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula. Disarmament — global nuclear disarmament in particular — is essential to engender a greater sense of security among Member States. India has been and will continue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global nuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation. We welcome the recommendation of the Secretary- General in his report to the Millennium Summit to convene an international conference on eliminating nuclear danger. We urge commencement of negotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring about a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains ready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps, such as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering nuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as well as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non- use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. The situation with regard to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of work at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva show the importance of building a consensus, both within and amongst nations, on issues that affect national and international security. We are conscious that 155 countries are at present signatories of the CTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing commitment that India does not wish to stand in the way of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered to observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on further explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic obligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban the future production of fissile material for weapons purposes. The illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of small arms, particularly by States to non-State actors and to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with terrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep concern to the world community. When they are combined with religious fanaticism and military adventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized norms to which we strive to adhere. The international community can no longer afford to permit these purveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue to inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look forward to a successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year. Terrorism is the global menace of our age. For some, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has been the object of State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more than a decade. Even as the international community works together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, we need to continually focus our attention on the users of such weapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on human decency, a violation of the basic precepts of democracy and the very antithesis of what the United Nations represents and stands for. Because its principal 18  targets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant violation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime against humanity. It is also a threat to international peace and security, especially when terrorists are armed, financed and backed by Governments or their agencies. I urge all Members to work to strengthen the international consensus and legal regimes against terrorism. We have proposed the draft of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. I urge all Members of the United Nations to give their total support to this initiative. Let me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our choice to accomplish our global agenda: the United Nations. There is but one United Nations; none replicate it, nor can any replace it. The membership of the United Nations has increased manifold in the last half century, and today stands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to have the same basic structure as in the colonized world of 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of the Security Council in both permanent and non- permanent categories is self-evident. The impact of actions of the Security Council is felt, with near total exclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have little influence in its decision-making. We have a global consensus that the form taken by the Security Council in the aftermath of the Second World War is outmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an enlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more than 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need for a Council reformed in its representation. An unrepresentative Security Council will lack the range and depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and understanding of the realities that it will have to deal with or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm India's willingness to take on the responsibilities of permanent membership. The General Assembly is the most important organ of the United Nations. It is here that all States, irrespective of considerations of strength, economy or size, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic principle of sovereign equality. There is a growing feeling among Member States that the functioning and role of the General Assembly has to be made more effective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce distance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together into a new global neighbourhood as never before in history, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead us to increasing interdependence, our canvas of international cooperation and collective action has rapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more complex. The General Assembly has therefore to be central in accepting this new responsibility, this new challenge. Even as we week to strengthen democratic principles and practices in the United Nations, and even as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have unfortunately witnessed some instances of regression as well. Such acts move against the currents of our times. The international community should oppose these assaults on the spirit of our times and uncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic impulses, practices and norms. It should show its solidarity with the people of such countries. The Organization of African Unity and the Commonwealth deserve our commendation for the steps they have taken in this regard. Developments in Fiji since 19 May this year have caused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken by the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the constitutionally elected democratic Government there. We hope that Fiji will return immediately to the constitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law at the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial discrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest. We hope that the international community will exercise its collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back to the road of democracy and the rule of law. It appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten Afghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country continues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the mirage of military success. It also continues because of outside support, military and financial, to the Taliban. This conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist ideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the Afghan people. This adversely affects the peace and security of the entire neighbourhood, from West to Central Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate from the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in the shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of arms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The Taliban and their mentor must heed the world's demands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for a comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that 19  restores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests and aspirations of all sections of that society. We have consistently called upon the United Nations to increase its development orientation and engagement, which is a core responsibility. We welcome and support the declaration of the Secretary- General last week to the United Nations Development Programme's ministerial meeting that deficit in development will put in jeopardy all other goals of the United Nations. To address the root causes of poverty meaningfully, we need firm international commitments to re-order and reshape international relations, in consequence providing for equitable opportunities to developing countries for resource earnings. Our call is even more relevant in today's fast integrating world. Developing countries and their people cannot thrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We therefore hope that the forthcoming conference on financing for development would endorse concrete initiatives for mobilization of the required external resources for development, whether from trade or concessional flows, and treat this as a shared global goal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the difference that would be made if there was universal adherence to the agreed official development assistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product(GNP), within a specified time frame. Nowhere is this more important than in the continent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be adequately supported by the international community. We believe that issues relating to the development of African countries must remain at the forefront of the work of the General Assembly. The process of globalization, with revolutionary leaps in communications and the great advance in information technology and increased mobility of capital, trade and technology, has produced new potential for sustained economic growth. The benefits of globalization have, however, not percolated to the vast sections who live mired in poverty, without shelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has often been accompanied by enhanced poverty, unemployment and consequent social disintegration. This poses a major challenge. We have to determine an inclusive concept of growth and development. We have to strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense, and not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While GDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to growth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and enhancement of the quality of life and creation of real choices must be integral to the process of assessing the success of development efforts. In India, we have formulated development strategies on the premise that economic and social policies must subserve the primacy of the human being, and in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth alone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee social justice is crucial. Development based on uneven rewards will not be supported by those who are not its beneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric. The fullest possible participation of the people in the development process is the best guarantee for the success of any growth strategy. Many challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to sustained economic growth for developing countries abound. Protectionist tendencies in developed countries, a lack of political will to implement commitments undertaken regarding development finance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of developing countries aggravate the situation. Special and differential treatment for developing countries guaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions must be translated into operational reality. Developed countries should not seek to restrict market access to goods and services and free movement of natural persons, especially at a time when developing countries are being asked to open up their economies and compete in the international economic domain. Another challenge relates to reconciling the needs of economic and industrial growth with the need for preservation and protection of the environment. A safe and healthy environment for our peoples is an imperative. At the same time, all development cannot be sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental preservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and environmental conservation cannot and should not imply maintenance of poverty. Developing countries have done commendable work in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the context of an exceptionally difficult global environment. The promised resources from developed countries have failed to materialize. The transfer of technologies on preferential and concessional terms has not been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed on technology transfer even on commercial terms. The special session of the United Nations General 20  Assembly on the review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should concentrate on finding solutions in addressing such unfulfilled commitments and providing reality and operational content to the declaration that “eradication of poverty is the over-riding priority of developing countries”. Children and issues relating to them are a priority. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly next year will concentrate on the implementation of the Declaration of the World Summit on Children. Advancement of the democratic spirit and overcoming challenges to it, growth with equity, economic development with social justice and, as the prize that we seek, the creation of a world where injustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and welfare for all are among the goals that we should set for ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The challenge is nothing less than collective enlightened global ownership. The General Assembly once again faces a heavy and challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let us wish ourselves success in our endeavours.            \n",

I am confident that his vision and energy will guide this session to a successful conclusion. I also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with distinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed Secretary-General of this Organization, for the thoughtful recommendations which he has put forward in his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have proved to be vital factors in advancing the work and mission of the United Nations at this critical time in the history of the Organization and the world. I join the previous speakers in welcoming the nation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of the United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also the smallest Member country of the Organization, with a population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square miles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the leader of that nation proudly take his place among the other leaders of the world in what was the largest gathering of heads of State or Government ever assembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There is a special affinity between the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We are among the smallest constituents of the Organization. We share similar historical and constitutional experiences. We face the same environmental threats. We look forward, with confidence, to a future involving the creative 29  utilization of the phenomenal developments in the area of information technology. My country's Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders from the Caribbean Community, of which he is the current Chairman, in denouncing the growing insensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of small developing countries on the part of the powerful in today's world. In his address to the Millennium Summit the Prime Minister noted that while our religious heritage has taught us how to reach across the boundaries of nations through the very inspirational guideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and vulnerable island States such as our own are being victimized by the application of international rules crafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes, oblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the well-being, of others. We are all affected by the modalities of the global village which we inhabit, through revolutionary developments in communication technology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours, and yet the competition among the world's peoples has become fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead and widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is now related not only to material wealth, but also, frighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries to compete in the accepted medium of communication, because of the existence of an ever-widening digital divide. The Millennium Summit concluded with the adoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming the importance of the United Nations and the need to strengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as making commitments to targeted reductions in poverty, the levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by impoverished nations around the world, the incidence and spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic education for all children. On the other hand, we are aware that the current world order is rapidly falling out of step with today's realities and that there is a pressing need for the international community to come together and address the numerous challenges before us. We must acknowledge that efforts to address old issues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well as new ones arising from globalization, the rapid growth of information technology and the resulting digital divide, the consequences of the environmental degradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender issues, among others, have largely been inadequate. Our common and daunting task is therefore to ensure that this globalized world will be beneficial for all and not just for some. More than ever before, there is an urgent need to foster a consciousness of universal moral values in order to deal with present-day problems, all of which are assuming an increasingly global dimension. The promotion of peace and human rights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and among States, the protection of immigrants, the safeguarding of the environment, the battle against terrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms trafficking, money laundering and economic and political corruption are issues which no nation, regardless of how wealthy or powerful, can successfully address alone. They concern the entire human community and must be addressed and resolved through common universal efforts. My country, a small State in the Caribbean, has always been aware of its interdependence with other countries for its prosperity and security. We have moved to advance our interests through multilateral cooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions of the United Nations system. For a small developing country like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, multilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of our policies and programmes to enhance our standard of living and create a better life for all of our people. I therefore reiterate my country's commitment to and support for the work of the United Nations and its agencies in this regard. The Millennium Summit provided an appropriate opportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate themselves to the attempt to have an impact on and change for the better the quality of life of the world's poorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of deprivation and suffering. The Summit will have proved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new millennium, but as an event that made the transition from words to deeds. The times demand nothing less. The security, welfare and development of people must, in the context of any new world order, dominate the attention of the world's multilateral financial institutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must undertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our people from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease. 30  While micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation programmes have been successful, much needs to be done to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions still suffer from hunger. We had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and drug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS are spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the Caribbean Community have placed combating this pandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This scourge has already claimed the lives of over 10 million people. It is projected to claim the lives of over 200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The developed world is not spared, either. Worldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are living with the disease, over 18 million have died since the beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million children have become orphaned. In the Caribbean region, the disease now threatens the human resource development efforts of CARICOM and could reverse the social and economic gains of the countries in that subregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean is estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the highest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second, in terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A United Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over 360,000 adults and children in our region were living with the disease. There is no immunity. International cooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields must be intensified if the disease is to be contained. We cannot preach about human rights and the universality of the United Nations while at the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that the time has come when serious consideration should be given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In this regard, my Government is urging that the subject be placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We urge every Member State of this noble Organization to give its full support to this worthy initiative for a country whose democratic credentials cannot be challenged. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the progress made in the Middle East peace process thus far, and expresses the hope that through dialogue, compromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace may become a reality. If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are to survive globalization, the international community must give careful and urgent consideration to the following measures: the revitalization of growth in developed countries; the lowering of interest rates; access to the world's markets for the products of developing countries; the reduction of debt and the debt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating situation in the marketing arrangements for primary products produced in the developing countries; economic diversification; increasing the levels of official development assistance and humanitarian aid; reductions in net capital flows from bilateral and multilateral sources; and combating the negative consequences of the graduation of some countries like ours, by international financial institutions, from concessionary funding arrangements. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the concerns of other developing countries with regard to the general decline in official development assistance and the flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries. We look forward to the consultation on financing for development planned for 2001. The changing world environment dictates the need for the revitalization and restructuring of the various organs of the United Nations organizations, but my Government attaches very high priority to the revitalization and strengthening of the role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for sound development, including economic development. We share the view that the United Nations should be encouraged to develop its full potential in the area of international economic cooperation and should be endowed with the requisite resources to contribute to solving the serious economic and social problems facing developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and development. We commend those donor countries that have made financial contributions to the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission to assist the development of an environmental vulnerability index, and call for the early adoption by the international community of a vulnerability index that would serve as a guide for multilateral financial institutions and the 31  United Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of developing countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other small island developing States in the strategically located Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the endemic problems of the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances. This modern day scourge continues to pose serious problems which threaten to destroy the social and moral fabric of our communities. My Government is fully committed to the ongoing process of cooperation with other countries to counter these illegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in this forum our complete support for the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the international fight against the drug trade. I also take this opportunity to urge that more resources be allocated through collaborative efforts by the international community to encourage farmers to keep away from the production of illicit crops. In his address to the Millennium Summit, the Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) spoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good governance and respect for human rights and democracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are aspects of our society of which we are eternally proud. Recently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our constitutional democracy was put to the test through open expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal through dialogue and compromise. My Government is pleased to put on record its appreciation to the Vincentian people for upholding democratic values and respecting the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law as fundamental principles by which our beloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to express gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to the National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to many individuals and other institutions for their invaluable contributions in bringing about a swift resolution of the matter. My Government has long recognized the urgent need for constitutional reform and will continue to work with other interested parties to bring about meaningful change that would seek, among other things, to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. As full members of this body, we have seen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional reform in the promotion of democracy, stability and economic development. We also recognize that constitutional reform is crucial to strengthening our own integration processes within the Caribbean Community, including the establishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be, inter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on matters pertaining to the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which established CARICOM. Many matters of profound importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean Community as a whole are included in the agenda of this fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These include: sustainable development, the future of United Nations reform, the International Criminal Court and human rights, the death penalty and financing for development. I wish, once again, to focus the attention of this noble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana trade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well documented. Banana exports to the European Union from my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint Lucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are crucial to the economies of these countries and represent over half of all export earnings in some cases. The industry provides substantial employment for many families in Dominica, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own country. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative of the efforts of the European Commission and other parties which seek to bring about an amicable and equitable solution to the dispute. However we are deeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime be eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this would have immeasurable harmful consequences for our economy. It will lead to the destruction of the Caribbean banana industry and negatively affect other ACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to the economy. The two alternative solutions being proposed by the European Commission, that is a first come, first served system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that proves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only system, would prove to be disadvantageous and 32  disastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system ensures access. We therefore urge the interested parties to the dispute to use their substantial influence to bring about the much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to all parties. An efficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will support our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable island State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining peace and economic security, which are vital for the achievement of economic diversification within a reasonable period of transition. While we recognize that there are structural and inherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to compete with highly integrated operations on the market, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in order to allow our people to engage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be forever subjected to the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry, which served us well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the realities of the present day trade and economic environment. My delegation also wishes to express its concern over the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within the WTO that would prevent consideration of the waiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement if it includes bananas without advice on how the regime will be formed. My country and other members of the Caribbean Community have been actively engaged in diversifying our economies throughout the last quarter of the last century. This has involved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing, tourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have improved air access to our country and my Government continues to prioritize the education of our people to prepare them for the opportunities that will accrue. My Government will continue to honour its commitments to all international agreements to which it is signatory. In furtherance to our international obligation we have signed the following: the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these instruments were deposited with the Secretary General during the Millennium Summit. During his speech at the Millennium Summit, Prime Minister Mitchell stated that: “Small island States such as our own, with an enviable record of good governance and human rights, have seen the mighty in the banana trade using the international rules — crafted by them — impede our economic growth.” Similarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on our financial services, without any deference to our rights to be heard, demonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small vulnerable States attempting to diversify their economies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment, “Where is the fairness in free trade?” Offshore financial services is one of our chosen avenues of economic diversification. We believe that we are capable of offering a useful, professional and mutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly, in 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative exercise to ensure that we would put in place a regulatory and supervisory framework to adequately administer the conduct of international financial businesses operating in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our regulatory regime against money laundering activities, we enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being a responsible member of the international community, including by playing its part in the war against money laundering. We believe that those who toil to build a better life for themselves, their children, their grandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be afforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such people should have access to facilities that will preserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be created for them to optimize and maximize their wealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we believe in the preservation of privacy, we are also resolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable character and conduct are not allowed to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in our international finance sector. 33  My country and others in the Caribbean Community are deeply concerned that the so-called harmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to frustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the sovereignty of small island States desperately seeking creative avenues for survival. Such action on the part of the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax cartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes from those who wish to legitimately escape them through the exercise of free choice. It would also close off an area of diversification and economic activity in which poor developing countries can be competitive and which they have actively promoted for a long time. The unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial Stability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force also impact negatively on the burden of taxation in wealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of Caribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global financial service and stifle economic growth in the 47 blacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils. The small island States of the Caribbean are among those countries most at risk from the adverse effects of climate change. Already, many of our islands are experiencing those effects in areas that impact directly on the important tourism sector of our economies. We are also prone to extremely damaging natural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm surges, which visit us annually with increasing frequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also experiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if less regularly than the pleasantly named perennials. The continued committed support of the international community is crucial in complementing the work of those States in addressing these serious problems. Our survival as a region is intimately interwoven with our environment. Our physical and economic limitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation of our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We therefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a nuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable development. In closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in this forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, through service to our country, to the Caribbean and to the international community. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of the Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an elected member of our legislature. He has seen our country through the stages of constitutional development from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime Minister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to contemplate public life without him. His address at the Millennium Summit was his last to this body, for he has decided to demit office as Prime Minister before the twenty-first anniversary of our political independence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell has made us all proud by his long, dedicated and visionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the area of land reform, which empowered people through land ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate that, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend sincere gratitude to him from this rostrum. The challenge is ours: to turn our words into action and to agree on a common vision of our future.           \n",
       "2  I convey to the President the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his election to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him Sri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work. To the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo- Ben Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and admiration for the masterly manner in which he served as President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations. The Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope that its dreams and hopes for a better world will never fade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed, 24  through a message I had the honour to read out to the Summit, her hopes and her vision for the future of humanity. Her words were these: “Peace among all States and peace among all peoples within States so that all, and not only some, may in safety, without fear, in dignity, without humiliation, in good health, and in material and spiritual well-being enjoy the wonders of life on this miracle we call the planet Earth.” (A/55/PV.7) Therefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with emphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving, for the future, those minimal and most fundamental certainties that the Member States of the United Nations have been able to establish — in particular, to preserve what was and continues to be the Organization's very foundation: the entity we know as the State. She pointed out that it was in the General Assembly that representatives of Governments, of peoples and of States gather together under a Charter that assures States of their sovereign equality, their political independence and their territorial integrity. These are the fundamentals of the United Nations system. And this is as it should be. States are the principal organizational entities into which the peoples of this planet have gathered. The principal, overall organizational edifice of the international community is the inter-States system. For the entity we know as the State, there is no substitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization. If States are diminished, so will this Organization be diminished. Thus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka that everything possible be done to protect and preserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the stability and the well-being of the entity we know as the State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence the Charter gave us its assurance. Before proceeding any further I should make it clear — in view of recent statements on the part of speakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with whose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ — that those who assert the necessity of continued reaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of the Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not be regarded — as having in any way diminished their commitment to the importance of universal adherence to human rights and all that is required for the dignity of the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its own people and of all peoples everywhere. There is, however, a substantial body of opinion, within which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the view that the way to proceed in the matter of human rights and the dignity of the individual is properly through continued and close cooperation between all States, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The way of multilateralism or globalization, which appear expressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall, a commendable course. It is not a course whose worthiness in practice has as yet been established. Indeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States have often had disastrous consequences. With that initial clarification and a reminder that human rights are for the observance not only of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall proceed with the remainder of my address. We must bear in mind that the entities we know as States are national and international corporate entities of enormous complexity, differing in so many respects from corporate entities of the private sector and, of course, differing as well from those innumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which we refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat simplistically, as civil society. If the management of a developed State with more than adequate resources at its command is a complex undertaking, how much more complex would be the management of a developing State without such resources and such infrastructures? Then there are those developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their multi-ethnic, multireligious societies where the legacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than one generation to erase. Aside from the pressures inherent in the very nature and history of a State, let us not forget the additional external pressures a State is subject to — economic, social and political, legitimate and illegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal — that the age of information and its consequences have brought in their wake. These are external pressures that raise troubling uncertainties for many States and for 25  developing States in particular, that are without the blessings of abundant resources and advanced infrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the structures of States and could come close to threatening their very existence. Where the processes of globalization are exploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the illegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the report from the Secretariat received by this Assembly three years ago which drew attention to the threat to Government authority and civil society, to law and order and to legitimate economic and political institutions posed by transnational networks of crime, narcotics, money laundering and terrorism having access to sophisticated information technologies and weaponry. Of course, where there is the use of internal armed force against a State, as in my country, the complexities within a State compound themselves many times over; and we know that the use of armed force against a State is the greatest threat of all to its preservation and well-being. This is particularly so in democracies, whose very openness makes them most vulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long- standing and unwavering commitment to democratic fundamentals. Peace among States, the primary purpose of the Charter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in fact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of generally observed rules of international law, under and pursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of armed force by one State against another State, except in self-defence or as authorized by the Security Council. Yet when we turn to peace within States, and the use of armed force against a State internally, we see an entirely different, and an often confusing and frustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each a creature of its own history; the nature of each determined by its own surroundings. There is no simplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario, no easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in many different forms. The relatively clear-cut format of a United Nations response to inter-State armed conflicts — monitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an agreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal armed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable. The Charter does not prescribe how this Organization should proceed in cases of internal armed conflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2, paragraph 7, which says, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.” In view of the varieties, complexities and intricacies of internal armed conflicts, this Organization appears to be without the necessary structure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and resources — and often, it would seem — without the necessary collective will. To suggest that the United Nations should intervene in internal armed conflicts across the board — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of obvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local circumstances — is wishful thinking of the most simplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme. A proposition of such a nature ignores the fundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so impressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of State of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his summation of the deliberations of round table four: that a democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental necessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political processes, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the democratically expressed will of the populace of a State, which an armed terroristic attack on a democratic State so obviously constitutes. At a more practical level, where would this Organization — woefully under-financed for the fulfilment of its development objectives, which billions around this world expectantly await — obtain the further resources for such far-flung interventions in internal domestic crises. Charter provisions and United Nations practice affirm that a State may act in individual or collective self-defence should there be an armed attack across its frontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack, the abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of most developing States — to react with equivalent armed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the law of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order, are very limited. Traditional police services are inadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in 26  experience. Few States have ready and affordable access to the necessary information or intelligence. Few States are able to maintain military infrastructures effective against heavily armed guerrilla-type onslaughts and the horrors of terror. Such has been the experience of my country. Sri Lanka has for many years had within its territory an armed conflict that has complicated the lives of the entire population of the country. It is a conflict of an extraordinary nature. A very small group of armed fighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000 persons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to violence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society and participatory governance; achieving, through the practice of systematic terror, national and international notoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such problems as they may have through dialogue — continues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion against the State to fight for the establishment of a separate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our territory. A democratic State, because of its openness, its laws, traditions and practices and its commitment to tolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the deployment of force against it by any group within its boundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State anywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere. Unless all States, democratic States in particular, agree to come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy itself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will not survive. When the security and integrity of one State is threatened by an armed group within it, surely — especially in these contemporary times, with the cold war far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny that armed group any encouragement, any succour, any safe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist activities in one country, massive funds are raised with impunity in other countries, often through knowing or unknowing front organizations or other entities that now proliferate in many forms and in many countries, and often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or groups ostensibly concerned with human rights or ethnic, cultural or social matters. The magnitude of the collection of funds abroad for terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the reach of the international networks developed for that purpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to exceed the receipts of many transnational conglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of course, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms or other merchandise, including the smuggling of humans. But there also exists a far more abundant and seemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely, expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the western media has reported over the past few years from time to time, collections from expatriates abroad for the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which is battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering in their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month from one country; $600,000 a month from another; $2.7 million a month from yet another; and large additional funds from expatriates in still other countries. In 1988 an excellent study was published on financial havens, banking secrecy and money laundering, a study by experts in the field, commissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. In order to implement adequately the provisions of the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by United Nations bodies on the collection of external funds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion against a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes especially necessary when the armed group battling a State is in blatant violation of the human rights and humanitarian norms and standards — including those relating to children and to children in armed conflict — that this Organization so correctly and so diligently espouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in human society. I proposed such a study at the fourth round table of the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was endorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of Algeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of the proceedings of our round table. I urge that the international community give favourable consideration to that proposal. As the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled by such massive funds from abroad continues within a State, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to blur, not only among those in civil society, who are often uninformed, but even on the part of those in positions of international authority, within and outside 27  this Organization, who should know better. The existence of the internal armed conflict and the resulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of hostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention to the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal group that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the victim. Such a blurring of international perceptions in some quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is distressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those, such as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and continue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic way of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic, multireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we were once so blessed to enjoy. I hope that the thoughts that I have expressed today on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the affairs of developing States in the main, will show in some measure why a sympathetic, rather than an inquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the affairs of States, as in all human relationships. At a more general level, I would like, before I move on from this part of my statement, to refer to two other relevant questions: the role of the General Assembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of the United Nations. The General Assembly is the only principal organ of the United Nations in which all Member States are represented, and the only principal organ whose terms of reference allow for consideration of any matter within the scope of the Charter. Yet there is the perception among some that the centre of gravity in decision-making on questions of major policy importance to the Organization appears to have moved away from the General Assembly to an extent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly welcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30 of the Millennium Declaration of the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy- making and representative organ of the United Nations, and the commitment of all nations to enable the General Assembly to play that role effectively. The practical manner in which the General Assembly could play that role will, of course, require very careful thought. The ways in which “civil society”, and the innumerable entities that that expression encompasses, could best contribute to the work of the United Nations — in terms of data collection, research and analysis and expertise — in a manner that does not prejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United Nations, will also require most careful examination. Such contributions should be made in a manner that is not partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but, rather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral consultant. Moreover, although civil society within a national context could be, and is, well accommodated in domestic political processes, the manner in which civil society could be internationally accommodated within United Nations processes still remains a puzzle. As in all human relationships, so also amongst States: the strong do better than the weak, the rich better than the poor, the developed better than the developing. This is the case most of all when times are hard. The marked decline in official development assistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the rich and the developed to meet their official development assistance pledges, show that for States, there is no general safety net. If there is one message from the Millennium Summit, and one that is now coming from this Millennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that globalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that no panacea for all — certainly not for the developing world. The benefits of globalization have by-passed much of the developing world. The poorest among us, spanning the continents of Africa, Central America and Asia, have experienced increasing marginalization. There is little opportunity for developing countries to be formative in the shaping of the world economy for the future — in the deliberations that really matter. Thus, although we are leaving the past century and the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their passing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by the old, intractable economic and social tragedies that have been with us since the dawn of time: poverty, illiteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the problems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and the growth of mega-cities. Among these, poverty alleviation and poverty elimination remain for most of us in the developing world the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful priority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of abundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in real time across billions of television screens throughout the world, undermines the very foundations 28  necessary for the growth of humane societies and refined governance. The developing world needs to be accorded an adequate formative voice in the formulation of a new development chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus we turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse, as it were, to this General Assembly, under whose active supervisory authority there must be a revival of a comprehensive North-South development dialogue — a dialogue that seems to be fading away. To tell the countless starving and helpless millions that a free global marketplace will show us the way is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough. Resource deprivation over many generations and its debilitating consequences on adequate infrastructural growth has severely damaged the capacity of developing countries to cope with the modern world. A new development chapter must provide for the catastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man- made” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the present surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in a decade that now place crushing burdens on the national economies of developing countries struggling desperately to contend with economic realities. They, like Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil- producing countries, which are certainly not insensitive to the plight of the developing world, will find it possible in some way to relieve such pressures in the very near future. I should also wish at this juncture in my address to say a word about the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of South Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is deeply committed to the advancement of the economic and social well-being of our peoples, numbering now in the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through national endeavour, but through regional and international cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current Chair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the programme of activities laid down at the 1991 Colombo summit as best it can in difficult circumstances. The people of our region are deeply committed to the goals of SAARC. They continue to interact vigorously on a wide range of professional, cultural, educational and social activities, notwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level political involvement that SAARC has suffered at this time. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be long before our movement is again able to play its full role in the welfare of our peoples. I have just returned to New York from the International Conference on War-Affected Children, organized so successfully by the Government of Canada and held at Winnipeg. I cannot conclude my address to the General Assembly this year without making at least a brief reference to the abominable crimes that are being committed against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka by the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They have been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year- old children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri Lankan Army. Some of these children have been programmed into suicide bombers. They are forced to wear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on them to evade capture. This wretched practice continues unabated. In 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, visited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger leaders. They assured him that they would not recruit any person under the age of 17 and would not send into battle any person below the age of 18. A few months ago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have been continuous reports of the recruitment and the use of children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they gave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant answer to a question by an interviewer, the Special Representative said this: “Children who become soldiers lose their innocence. Part of the reason why the fighting groups will tend to reach out to children is because, of course, the adults may become disillusioned, they may be killed off, they may run away, so they reach the children who are less able to defend themselves. But there's a more cynical reason than that: children, because they are innocent, can be moulded into the most unquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into suicide commandos, into committing the worst atrocities. In other situations, it is ideology — come fight for the homeland, come fight for our ethnic group, come fight for a new society — that may appeal to families and to children. So there 29  are many reasons which facilitate the abuse of children in this way.” I thank the Special Representative for having had the courage to speak out on this important issue. To remain silent in the face of such criminality is to encourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us who care about the children of the world to rally against the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm cynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one that abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the representative of the United Nations Children's Fund in Sri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his statement — that the situation of children in the areas held by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave their assurance to the United Nations Special Representative. Parents have reported that their children have been recruited. It is a serious problem. He observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people that they have taken measures to prevent children below 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take their promises seriously. A respected and courageous human rights group in Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who used to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent report that since last May a fresh child-recruitment campaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers. According to their report, children as young as 10 years are being forcibly conscripted, age being no consideration as long as the child was able to carry a gun. In recent days and months the international press has focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in Sri Lanka. A few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol has noted that the Statute of the International Criminal Court makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in combat a war crime in both international and non- international armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors also accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State parties to cooperate in preventing and combating such crimes. Accordingly, today, in this General Assembly of the United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to ratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties on whose territory the LTTE has offices and front organizations to take strong punitive action against such establishments, and to declare the LTTE a criminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal activity in respect of the use of child soldiers through funds generated on the territories of other State parties, which are obliged to cooperate in terms of the Convention and the Protocol. The Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with an impassioned plea to the world to move urgently from words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands of children who are abused, maimed, displaced, traumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if anything should stir the conscience of mankind it is surely the plight of these children. Let it not be said that yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed the anguished cry of children in distress, children on whom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict, unspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on the issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not required to save them. What is required is the will and the commitment to act of those States which are in a position to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to them. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal now so that when the special session of the General Assembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for Children is held here in New York next September, we will be able to adopt practical measures that will finally ensure that children will be forever protected from the ravages of war.                \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Allow me, Sir, at the outset to congratulate you heartily on your election to the Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a close friend and partner within the Nordic community. We wish you success with this challenging task and pledge to you the full support of the Icelandic delegation. The Millennium Declaration provides the commitments of the world community in the new century. To prevent conflicts, maintain international peace and security and make peace an achievable goal at the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue strengthening the United Nations and the international legal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported verifiable arms control and arms reduction measures and will continue to support realistic disarmament proposals aiming at maximum security with a minimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the enormous sums being spent on weapons, while the money could be used to significantly improve the lives of millions. Today, when there is an obvious need to assess the United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping operations, it has proved extremely important to have a Secretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of the matter through his own experience. I would like to commend the Secretary-General for taking the initiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the field to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi report. Its recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. Even though my country does not have a military, it has been able to participate in peacekeeping operations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing medical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of law, the media and women's rights. We have noted with interest the recommendations made in the Brahimi report concerning the non-military aspects of peace operations. We will be studying them carefully now that we are in the process of looking into how we can strengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the future. The report states that expressions of general support in the form of statements and resolutions must be followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking these words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making. In the preparations for the Millennium Assembly, the Secretary-General encouraged Member States to engage more effectively in the international legal framework by acceding to a number of legal instruments. One to which Iceland has decided to accede is the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. The Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded in reflecting the tremendous changes in the international arena which have taken place since its establishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years to come, the reform process has to be accelerated. The rules of international law governing the relations between States are now well established; this also applies in the fields of human rights and humanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and obligations of States and individuals. But ground rules do not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them. There are mechanisms to ensure respect and compliance with these rules, such as the General Assembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping missions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an effective international court system should be available to bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the same time serving to deter potential perpetrators. With this in mind, I believe that the greatest achievements towards strengthening the international legal system in recent years have been the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the Rome Statute and encourages all other States to do so. I welcome the proposal to include cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I had the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well aware of the important contribution made by the Council to peace and stability in Europe, especially in the field of human rights. The United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations 14  responded to the serious situation in the Balkans by joining forces and working together to make reconstruction achievable. In Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter- ethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements cannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by the international community. One ethnic group must not be allowed to win at the expense of another. The Kosovars have been provided with a unique opportunity to build a just community in the region — a community where the fundamental freedoms and rights of every individual and minority group are respected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are Kosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation for lasting peace and stability for future generations. The same can be said about similar situations elsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international community has taken on an enormous task in building a whole new civic structure within Kosovo. The development of a legal system and free media have been two challenging tasks. The elections to take place in October are also going to be challenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an orderly and peaceful manner. It is very important to include women in the political process. In this respect, I would like to commend the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in Kosovo, not only in the political field but also in fighting violence against women and in promoting women's participation in economic activities. The importance of human rights in securing long- term stability and security, both within and between countries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore essential that no compromises be accepted in this field, and our aims should remain high. The Security Council should be commended for discussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security threat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of children and armed conflict. The discussion in the Council has served to concentrate the attention of the international community on these issues and led the way for others to take the measures required. Both issues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect them to feature prominently on the agenda of next year's special session to follow up the World Summit for Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a special session of the General Assembly on the enormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international efforts to combat it. The rights of women were significantly enhanced with the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the Protocol and is preparing its ratification. I cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of those women around the world who are still enduring major human rights abuses, including female genital mutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the right to work. During the Millennium Summit, the Prime Minister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland welcomes their adoption and hopes that they will further secure the human rights of children. We have to put extra effort into working towards the elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying to note the trend towards increasing racism and xenophobia in certain parts of the world, including Europe. This needs to be fought at all levels. The World Conference to be held in South Africa next year will without doubt play an important role. Iceland welcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of history, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it. As reflected in the report of the Secretary- General, “We the peoples”, fighting poverty remains one of the main challenges to the United Nations. People living in poverty do not have the opportunity to exercise many of their fundamental rights and freedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of globalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as decided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to be done. Globalization and new technologies offer many opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate than in the past. We have been strengthening our development cooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the bilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of African countries with a focus on strengthening their fishing industry and education and health areas, with the potential to positively alter the lives of people in need. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative 15  through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Most of our decisions are based on compromises, in which each and every one of us has to give a little in order to reach an agreement. It is very important to keep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance, but also when the time comes for us to pay our dues, both to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping budget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this Organization that all Members pay their contributions fully, on time and without any conditions. In recent years, the oceans of the world have received increased attention in the General Assembly. We welcome this development. Iceland's economy is based on the sustainable harvest of living marine resources. The health and responsible stewardship of the oceans are therefore of critical importance to us. Last year, we resolved to improve United Nations coordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that end, we established an Informal Consultative Process to discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceans and the law of the sea. I was pleased with the implementation of this decision of the first Meeting of this Process last spring. However, we must act carefully when seeking to improve our coordination and cooperation in this area. Ocean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level and be consistent with the rights and obligations laid down in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must fully respect the sovereign right of States over their natural resources and the competence of existing international organizations. Above all, the integrity of the Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful that the Convention provides the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. The United Nations specialized agencies have an important role to play in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this respect is marine scientific research. We need more accurate and policy-oriented information on the state of the oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a worthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs. At the onset of a new millennium, it is more pressing than ever before to ensure the access of people in the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to readily available and sustainable energy. Today, about one third of the world's population does not have such access, and this situation is obviously a serious obstacle to the development of these communities. In my country, we have been able to bring sustainable energy to all households in the country. We are sharing our experience and knowledge with the developing countries through the United Nations University Geothermal Training Programme, which is located in Iceland and funded by my Government. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a momentum for building a secure future for humankind and life on Earth under the banner of sustainable development. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a global conference to take stock of the progress made in meeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and the other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have not been able to live up to all the expectations raised in Rio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the progress that we have made. The concept of sustainable development has truly become accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in environmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own country, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe that we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use regime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy ecosystem and a robust economy. Regional and international efforts to prevent the pollution of the oceans have continued to gather strength and we can expect further efforts, in particular to control pollution from land-based sources. It is my belief that, in charting a course for the future, we should be looking at success stories and learning from them, rather than concentrating on the obstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but not the doom-sayers.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         “We, the peoples” is a powerful rendition of world affairs and a daunting portrait of life for future generations. It took intellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex case in such a concise and forceful way. We are grateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for producing it. “We, the peoples” are of course the opening words of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point of departure. Other speakers have done so before me and have argued in favour of a more robust structure for keeping the peace in the world community. They are right. The United Nations role in the area of preventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as its principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown how, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping function has in fact become its Achilles heel. The Brahimi recommendations deserve to be implemented — the sooner the better. At present, the Netherlands Government and parliament are debating how to improve our national contribution to peacekeeping. 15  “We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a totally different side of the United Nations reality as well. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in favour of closer ties between the United Nations and the private sector. In 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter hinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of life as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and security to social justice, from economic cooperation to human rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly mentions any other actors besides States. Non- governmental organizations appear in the Charter only once. The private sector is not referred to at all. In other words, the Charter conforms to a model of governance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state system going back to the mid-1600s. In order to strategize for the future, we need to ask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world today; where and how are world affairs conducted; and how can we position the United Nations accordingly? The United Nations is made up of Member States. That is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians of foreign relations for a long time to come. But their roles have changed significantly with time. States can no longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of international relations. Internationalization has altered the concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous entities as before, pursuing self-defined national interests. Their actions are now much more shaped by economic pressures, information flows, and population movements. For States, too, globalization is here to stay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and international scenes. Civil society is one. The private sector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of non-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide spectrum, beyond any expectation of the United Nations founding fathers. Many non-governmental organizations operate across national boundaries. At the present time, the United Nations system could never hope to operate properly without the assistance of non-governmental organizations, not to mention normative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental organizations have acquired access to the United Nations at different levels, and participate in many of its discussions. Although a potent actor on the domestic and international levels, the private sector has been virtually ignored by traditional United Nations diplomacy. The business community, and notably transnational corporations, were viewed by many as the competitor, if not as the enemy of international public interest. Documents critical of multinationals were being issued by the United Nations and the specialized agencies until recently. Confrontation rather than dialogue. I am not contending that there were no grounds for that position: quite the contrary. However, nowadays we see a growing awareness in the business community of the necessity of responsible corporate policies and of a role for private enterprise in the pursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing immediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the pharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with international organizations, Governments and other actors. We need to build on that. Indeed, the time has come to expand the concept of a partnership with the private sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the world is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the private sector does exist and wields a lot of power in the international arena. About the odds: take a sustainable future, where elementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not even the most powerful Government can put a stop to global warming — nor all the Member States of the United Nations combined. A sustainable future needs to be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society and the scientific community. For equitable working conditions, and other forms of social justice, States need to involve the private sector. The same is true for fighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting water or AIDS. We have truly entered an era that is very different from the one in which the United Nations was born — an era in which the course of humanity and the quality of life on earth have more and more become a shared responsibility; an era where Governments, the private sector and civil society are drawn ever more closely together. They all have a stake in global governance. The so-called global public goods are a matter for all of them together. The private sector has a stake in the future of the planet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no planet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own interest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight in international relations and the influence they have at 16  the domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want a livable world for their grandchildren. The private sector must be called upon to enter into a responsible corporate partnership in sync with other actors at the international plane. True, the role of each actor needs to be different. Their motivation can remain different, too — as does the legal basis on which they act. But their determination needs to be the same: the determination to secure the longevity of life as we know it and to secure for everyone on the planet an equitable share of its bounty. Different roles, shared responsibility. That concept needs to take root in this Organization as well. The United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a galvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the coming century if it cannot show that its debates and its action platforms reflect the real world outside the conference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations as “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium report puts it — it must be able to show that all players are on the stage. The Secretary-General's Global Compact could not have come at a more opportune moment. It is the mere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising start. The Global Compact deserves the active support of the international community, and it deserves to be joined by other multinationals. I do understand the trepidations of some non-governmental organizations who fear that multinational corporations will drape themselves in the United Nations flag and become untouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too, the apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who have a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State and its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the Global Compact is not a Trojan horse. And I will go even further. We have given civil society structural access to the United Nations system. By contrast, the access we are giving to the private sector, with the notable exception of the International Labour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural. In the future, we must create appropriate channels of communication with the private sector, inside this Organization, where they, as well as Governments and civil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions of our time — a forum where, at the very least, they can deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of mistrust that have divided them for so long. That is the first reason why the United Nations needs to broaden its scope and become more inclusive. The second is the power of the private sector. Many companies have turnovers larger than the national budgets of some Member States, and the same is true for the personal fortunes of some chief executive officers. The relationship between States and the private sector has altered dramatically over time. States were once thought of as bulwarks against harmful economic impact from abroad. Economic weight was viewed as a trump card in the power play among nations. Today, States are increasingly serving as instruments for adjusting domestic policy to the realities of the present-day world economy. They have become intermediaries between the world economy, with its own structure of power, and domestic societies. This brings up the question of where world affairs are being conducted and how they have caused a shift in the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has shifted the focus of attention to forums other than the United Nations here in New York, notably to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the European Union. Policies are tested in the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos or decided elsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs. That focus has brought on a different cast of players than in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign Ministers now work shoulder to shoulder not only with development ministers, but also with finance and trade ministers, as well as with central bankers. International affairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about economics. Forging a relationship with the private sector is therefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to preserve its relevance over the long haul. The multilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties with other centres of power and with the business community. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously pursuing closer relations with all these various forums, and we encourage him to do more of the same. Responsible corporate partnership is also about protecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not only to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure freedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages, globalization is leaving too many victims by the wayside. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in war and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields 17  a great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will buy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly on the quality of life in many developing countries. Even though the odds are staggering, the United Nations system can make a difference in reducing poverty, gender inequality and child and maternal mortality. But it can make a difference only from a position of strength and from a platform shared by other actors at the international level: from a position of shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has declared poverty eradication the United Nations number one priority. We applaud that. But fighting poverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has been; it has also become an economic one. That is another reason for the United Nations to become more inclusive of the private sector. The Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We the peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take the United Nations forward. Whatever the way forward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we have been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we have kept the United Nations on a very short leash, hardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of the same is not enough. In other words, the United Nations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples, pursue our business as usual. The future will pass us by. The alternative is an avenue that is much more ambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations system as a vehicle for the development of a new vision of world politics, a vision for the “post- Westphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends would be given legitimacy and a conceptual framework. In such a vision, the principle of non- intervention yields to the defence of human rights; sovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for civil society and the private sector; and economics are also held responsible for social and development goals. Such is the road less travelled, but the only one that can make all the difference.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            India congratulates Mr. Harri Holkeri on his election as President of the first General Assembly of this millennium. We are encouraged that he intends to take the Millennium Declaration as the mandate for the work of the Organization during his presidency. I take this opportunity to sincerely compliment and to place on record our high appreciation of Foreign Minister Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia for his guidance of the General Assembly in the past year, which included three special sessions and, of course, meticulous preparations for and a successful conclusion to the Millennium Summit. I join India's voice to those of other delegations in noting with appreciation the dedication with which Secretary-General Kofi Annan has served the United Nations at a critical point. I am delighted on this occasion to warmly welcome Tuvalu as the newest Member of the United Nations. Just 10 days ago, almost 150 heads of State and Government assembled here for the Millennium Summit. Their assembly in such large numbers was as unique as was the occasion itself. The Millennium Declaration that was then adopted encapsulates a shared vision that the international community work together in constructive cooperation to meet collective challenges, within the framework of the United Nations. It was in this spirit that my Prime Minister spoke, as did many others, of the need for the United Nations to truly reflect the world of the twenty-first century, to make it an effective instrument to translate 17  our vision into reality. The United Nations is the house that we all share. We must strengthen it and ensure that it is equal to our collective expectations and our joint aspirations. Peace, collective security and development inspire the spirit of the United Nations. We enter the twenty-first century with extraordinary collective intellectual and technical capabilities. These are our global tools for overcoming the challenges before us. Peace and security for all is not just possible but is well within our grasp. Stability and development are the essential building blocks for the maintenance of peace and security. Threats to peace can and do arise from different sources. It is not just weapons of mass destruction or an arms race that endanger peace, but also dehumanizing poverty and lack of development. We must act as confident nation States committed to collective action and international cooperation, for these are our means to provide wider effects of peace and progress. We must reaffirm the principle of respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of countries. Thus, self-evidently, we must abjure unilateral action. Whenever circumstances warrant action by the Security Council, that action must be firmly rooted in Charter provisions. The Brahimi Panel's report contains a number of proposals. We recommend that the General Assembly examine this important report carefully and take appropriate decisions to strengthen this vital United Nations function of peacekeeping. We support the Middle East peace process and find the trend encouraging. The historic summit between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, too, augurs well for peace in the Korean peninsula. Disarmament — global nuclear disarmament in particular — is essential to engender a greater sense of security among Member States. India has been and will continue to be in the forefront of efforts towards global nuclear disarmament and genuine non-proliferation. We welcome the recommendation of the Secretary- General in his report to the Millennium Summit to convene an international conference on eliminating nuclear danger. We urge commencement of negotiations on a nuclear-weapons convention to bring about a nuclear-weapon-free world. India remains ready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps, such as de-alerting of nuclear forces, thus lowering nuclear danger, through accidental use or otherwise, as well as a global agreement on no-first-use and on non- use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. The situation with regard to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the lack of progress on a programme of work at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva show the importance of building a consensus, both within and amongst nations, on issues that affect national and international security. We are conscious that 155 countries are at present signatories of the CTBT. We reiterate to them our continuing commitment that India does not wish to stand in the way of entry into force of the CTBT. India volunteered to observe, and continues to observe, a moratorium on further explosive nuclear testing. This meets the basic obligations of the CTBT. India also remains ready to engage in meaningful negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, including on a global treaty to ban the future production of fissile material for weapons purposes. The illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of small arms, particularly by States to non-State actors and to terrorist groups, and their intrinsic linkage with terrorism and narco-trafficking are matters of very deep concern to the world community. When they are combined with religious fanaticism and military adventurism, a threat is posed to the global civilized norms to which we strive to adhere. The international community can no longer afford to permit these purveyors of death, outrage and destruction to continue to inflict untold suffering upon innocents. We look forward to a successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, to be held next year. Terrorism is the global menace of our age. For some, it tends to replace ideology and policy. India has been the object of State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism in its most inhuman manifestations for more than a decade. Even as the international community works together to curb, control and stamp out the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, we need to continually focus our attention on the users of such weapons — the terrorists. Terrorism is an assault on human decency, a violation of the basic precepts of democracy and the very antithesis of what the United Nations represents and stands for. Because its principal 18  targets are the innocent, it is indeed the most flagrant violation of basic human rights. It constitutes a crime against humanity. It is also a threat to international peace and security, especially when terrorists are armed, financed and backed by Governments or their agencies. I urge all Members to work to strengthen the international consensus and legal regimes against terrorism. We have proposed the draft of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. I urge all Members of the United Nations to give their total support to this initiative. Let me now dwell briefly on the instrument of our choice to accomplish our global agenda: the United Nations. There is but one United Nations; none replicate it, nor can any replace it. The membership of the United Nations has increased manifold in the last half century, and today stands at 189. Yet the Security Council continues to have the same basic structure as in the colonized world of 1945. The need for expansion of the membership of the Security Council in both permanent and non- permanent categories is self-evident. The impact of actions of the Security Council is felt, with near total exclusivity, by the developing countries. Yet they have little influence in its decision-making. We have a global consensus that the form taken by the Security Council in the aftermath of the Second World War is outmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an enlarged membership. At the Millennium Summit more than 150 States, at the highest level, endorsed the need for a Council reformed in its representation. An unrepresentative Security Council will lack the range and depth of sensitivity, perceptiveness and understanding of the realities that it will have to deal with or the moral authority to take decisions. I reaffirm India's willingness to take on the responsibilities of permanent membership. The General Assembly is the most important organ of the United Nations. It is here that all States, irrespective of considerations of strength, economy or size, sit together as equals, embodying the democratic principle of sovereign equality. There is a growing feeling among Member States that the functioning and role of the General Assembly has to be made more effective. As the revolutions of the digital age reduce distance to the click of a mouse, bringing us together into a new global neighbourhood as never before in history, and as forces of globalization inexorably lead us to increasing interdependence, our canvas of international cooperation and collective action has rapidly expanded. It has also become vastly more complex. The General Assembly has therefore to be central in accepting this new responsibility, this new challenge. Even as we week to strengthen democratic principles and practices in the United Nations, and even as the spreading sweep of democracy casts aside dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, we have unfortunately witnessed some instances of regression as well. Such acts move against the currents of our times. The international community should oppose these assaults on the spirit of our times and uncompromisingly support and strengthen democratic impulses, practices and norms. It should show its solidarity with the people of such countries. The Organization of African Unity and the Commonwealth deserve our commendation for the steps they have taken in this regard. Developments in Fiji since 19 May this year have caused us deep concern. We appreciate the action taken by the Commonwealth after the overthrow of the constitutionally elected democratic Government there. We hope that Fiji will return immediately to the constitutional base of 1997 and restore the rule by law at the earliest opportunity by putting an end to racial discrimination. This is in Fiji's own long-term interest. We hope that the international community will exercise its collective authority and influence to bring Fiji back to the road of democracy and the rule of law. It appears, sadly, that the world has forgotten Afghanistan. The fratricidal conflict in that country continues on account of the Taliban's pursuit of the mirage of military success. It also continues because of outside support, military and financial, to the Taliban. This conflict and the Taliban's mediaeval obscurantist ideologies continue to cause untold suffering to the Afghan people. This adversely affects the peace and security of the entire neighbourhood, from West to Central Asia to South Asia. The negatives that emanate from the Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan, in the shape of terrorism, drug trafficking and the flow of arms, cause justifiable concern all over the world. The Taliban and their mentor must heed the world's demands and abandon the path of conflict. We stand for a comprehensive settlement in Afghanistan that 19  restores peace at the earliest and ensures the interests and aspirations of all sections of that society. We have consistently called upon the United Nations to increase its development orientation and engagement, which is a core responsibility. We welcome and support the declaration of the Secretary- General last week to the United Nations Development Programme's ministerial meeting that deficit in development will put in jeopardy all other goals of the United Nations. To address the root causes of poverty meaningfully, we need firm international commitments to re-order and reshape international relations, in consequence providing for equitable opportunities to developing countries for resource earnings. Our call is even more relevant in today's fast integrating world. Developing countries and their people cannot thrive on a diet of advice and goodwill alone. We therefore hope that the forthcoming conference on financing for development would endorse concrete initiatives for mobilization of the required external resources for development, whether from trade or concessional flows, and treat this as a shared global goal. In this context, it would be useful to establish the difference that would be made if there was universal adherence to the agreed official development assistance(ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product(GNP), within a specified time frame. Nowhere is this more important than in the continent of Africa. Africa's efforts need to be adequately supported by the international community. We believe that issues relating to the development of African countries must remain at the forefront of the work of the General Assembly. The process of globalization, with revolutionary leaps in communications and the great advance in information technology and increased mobility of capital, trade and technology, has produced new potential for sustained economic growth. The benefits of globalization have, however, not percolated to the vast sections who live mired in poverty, without shelter, in hunger and in deprivation. Globalization has often been accompanied by enhanced poverty, unemployment and consequent social disintegration. This poses a major challenge. We have to determine an inclusive concept of growth and development. We have to strive for the uplifting of people in the largest sense, and not simply in terms of sectoral advances. While GDP growth rates and selective indicators may point to growth in an economy, the elimination of poverty and enhancement of the quality of life and creation of real choices must be integral to the process of assessing the success of development efforts. In India, we have formulated development strategies on the premise that economic and social policies must subserve the primacy of the human being, and in particular the poorest. Market forces and growth alone are not the answer. Intervention to guarantee social justice is crucial. Development based on uneven rewards will not be supported by those who are not its beneficiaries. It places great stress on the social fabric. The fullest possible participation of the people in the development process is the best guarantee for the success of any growth strategy. Many challenges lie ahead of us. Impediments to sustained economic growth for developing countries abound. Protectionist tendencies in developed countries, a lack of political will to implement commitments undertaken regarding development finance and tardy alleviation of the debt burden of developing countries aggravate the situation. Special and differential treatment for developing countries guaranteed under World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions must be translated into operational reality. Developed countries should not seek to restrict market access to goods and services and free movement of natural persons, especially at a time when developing countries are being asked to open up their economies and compete in the international economic domain. Another challenge relates to reconciling the needs of economic and industrial growth with the need for preservation and protection of the environment. A safe and healthy environment for our peoples is an imperative. At the same time, all development cannot be sacrificed at the absolutist altar of environmental preservation. Sustainability of growth strategy and environmental conservation cannot and should not imply maintenance of poverty. Developing countries have done commendable work in the implementation of Agenda 21, in the context of an exceptionally difficult global environment. The promised resources from developed countries have failed to materialize. The transfer of technologies on preferential and concessional terms has not been forthcoming. Indeed, impediments are placed on technology transfer even on commercial terms. The special session of the United Nations General 20  Assembly on the review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 in 2002 should concentrate on finding solutions in addressing such unfulfilled commitments and providing reality and operational content to the declaration that “eradication of poverty is the over-riding priority of developing countries”. Children and issues relating to them are a priority. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly next year will concentrate on the implementation of the Declaration of the World Summit on Children. Advancement of the democratic spirit and overcoming challenges to it, growth with equity, economic development with social justice and, as the prize that we seek, the creation of a world where injustice and deprivation give way to fulfilment and welfare for all are among the goals that we should set for ourselves at the dawn of this new century. The challenge is nothing less than collective enlightened global ownership. The General Assembly once again faces a heavy and challenging agenda on this long road before us. Let us wish ourselves success in our endeavours.           \n",

I am confident that his vision and energy will guide this session to a successful conclusion. I also thank Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, who led the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly with distinction and efficiency. I commend Mr. Kofi Annan, the esteemed Secretary-General of this Organization, for the thoughtful recommendations which he has put forward in his report to the Millennium Summit entitled “We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”. His vision and stewardship have proved to be vital factors in advancing the work and mission of the United Nations at this critical time in the history of the Organization and the world. I join the previous speakers in welcoming the nation of Tuvalu as the 189th and newest Member of the United Nations family. Our newest entrant is also the smallest Member country of the Organization, with a population of 10,000 and a land area of nine square miles. It was very pleasing to my delegation to see the leader of that nation proudly take his place among the other leaders of the world in what was the largest gathering of heads of State or Government ever assembled in one place, the Millennium Summit. There is a special affinity between the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Tuvalu. We are among the smallest constituents of the Organization. We share similar historical and constitutional experiences. We face the same environmental threats. We look forward, with confidence, to a future involving the creative 29  utilization of the phenomenal developments in the area of information technology. My country's Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell, joined other leaders from the Caribbean Community, of which he is the current Chairman, in denouncing the growing insensitivity towards and disregard for the interests of small developing countries on the part of the powerful in today's world. In his address to the Millennium Summit the Prime Minister noted that while our religious heritage has taught us how to reach across the boundaries of nations through the very inspirational guideline, “love your neighbour as yourself”, small and vulnerable island States such as our own are being victimized by the application of international rules crafted by the mighty to serve their own purposes, oblivious to the concerns, and consequences for the well-being, of others. We are all affected by the modalities of the global village which we inhabit, through revolutionary developments in communication technology. Indeed, we have all become neighbours, and yet the competition among the world's peoples has become fiercer, with the rich countries surging ahead and widening the gap with poor countries. This gap is now related not only to material wealth, but also, frighteningly, to the ability of less developed countries to compete in the accepted medium of communication, because of the existence of an ever-widening digital divide. The Millennium Summit concluded with the adoption by world leaders of a Declaration affirming the importance of the United Nations and the need to strengthen its peacekeeping operations, as well as making commitments to targeted reductions in poverty, the levels of inhuman living conditions experienced by impoverished nations around the world, the incidence and spread of HIV/AIDS and the provision of basic education for all children. On the other hand, we are aware that the current world order is rapidly falling out of step with today's realities and that there is a pressing need for the international community to come together and address the numerous challenges before us. We must acknowledge that efforts to address old issues, like world poverty and its distribution, as well as new ones arising from globalization, the rapid growth of information technology and the resulting digital divide, the consequences of the environmental degradation of our planet, HIV/AIDS and gender issues, among others, have largely been inadequate. Our common and daunting task is therefore to ensure that this globalized world will be beneficial for all and not just for some. More than ever before, there is an urgent need to foster a consciousness of universal moral values in order to deal with present-day problems, all of which are assuming an increasingly global dimension. The promotion of peace and human rights, the settling of armed conflicts, both within and among States, the protection of immigrants, the safeguarding of the environment, the battle against terrible diseases, the fight against drug and arms trafficking, money laundering and economic and political corruption are issues which no nation, regardless of how wealthy or powerful, can successfully address alone. They concern the entire human community and must be addressed and resolved through common universal efforts. My country, a small State in the Caribbean, has always been aware of its interdependence with other countries for its prosperity and security. We have moved to advance our interests through multilateral cooperation in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), CARICOM, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the Commonwealth and the institutions of the United Nations system. For a small developing country like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, multilateralism is not an option; it is an integral part of our policies and programmes to enhance our standard of living and create a better life for all of our people. I therefore reiterate my country's commitment to and support for the work of the United Nations and its agencies in this regard. The Millennium Summit provided an appropriate opportunity for the assembled leaders to rededicate themselves to the attempt to have an impact on and change for the better the quality of life of the world's poorest people, who are trapped in a vicious cycle of deprivation and suffering. The Summit will have proved worthwhile if it is remembered not as a highprofile event to make the transition to a new millennium, but as an event that made the transition from words to deeds. The times demand nothing less. The security, welfare and development of people must, in the context of any new world order, dominate the attention of the world's multilateral financial institutions, as well as of the United Nations. We must undertake sustained and concerted efforts to free our people from poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease. 30  While micro-credit and other poverty-alleviation programmes have been successful, much needs to be done to eradicate poverty. In this era of plenty, millions still suffer from hunger. We had curbed old diseases like malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, but they have reappeared in new and drug-resistant forms. Deadly diseases like HIV/AIDS are spreading at an alarming pace. The leaders of the Caribbean Community have placed combating this pandemic at the top of the regional agenda. This scourge has already claimed the lives of over 10 million people. It is projected to claim the lives of over 200 million by the year 2010, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The developed world is not spared, either. Worldwide figures indicate that 34 million people are living with the disease, over 18 million have died since the beginning of the epidemic and over 13 million children have become orphaned. In the Caribbean region, the disease now threatens the human resource development efforts of CARICOM and could reverse the social and economic gains of the countries in that subregion. The prevalence rate in the wider Caribbean is estimated at 172 cases per 100,000 people, the highest rate of prevalence in the Americas, and second, in terms of the growth rate, to sub-Saharan Africa. A United Nations AIDS survey in 1999 showed that over 360,000 adults and children in our region were living with the disease. There is no immunity. International cooperation in the medical, ethical and legal fields must be intensified if the disease is to be contained. We cannot preach about human rights and the universality of the United Nations while at the same time ignoring the aspirations of over 23 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan. It is the view of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines delegation that the time has come when serious consideration should be given to the eligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. In this regard, my Government is urging that the subject be placed on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We urge every Member State of this noble Organization to give its full support to this worthy initiative for a country whose democratic credentials cannot be challenged. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the progress made in the Middle East peace process thus far, and expresses the hope that through dialogue, compromise and goodwill, the dream of lasting peace may become a reality. If countries like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are to survive globalization, the international community must give careful and urgent consideration to the following measures: the revitalization of growth in developed countries; the lowering of interest rates; access to the world's markets for the products of developing countries; the reduction of debt and the debt-service burden; the reversal of the deteriorating situation in the marketing arrangements for primary products produced in the developing countries; economic diversification; increasing the levels of official development assistance and humanitarian aid; reductions in net capital flows from bilateral and multilateral sources; and combating the negative consequences of the graduation of some countries like ours, by international financial institutions, from concessionary funding arrangements. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shares the concerns of other developing countries with regard to the general decline in official development assistance and the flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries. We look forward to the consultation on financing for development planned for 2001. The changing world environment dictates the need for the revitalization and restructuring of the various organs of the United Nations organizations, but my Government attaches very high priority to the revitalization and strengthening of the role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for sound development, including economic development. We share the view that the United Nations should be encouraged to develop its full potential in the area of international economic cooperation and should be endowed with the requisite resources to contribute to solving the serious economic and social problems facing developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and development. We commend those donor countries that have made financial contributions to the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission to assist the development of an environmental vulnerability index, and call for the early adoption by the international community of a vulnerability index that would serve as a guide for multilateral financial institutions and the 31  United Nations on the specific vulnerabilities of developing countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, like other small island developing States in the strategically located Caribbean, continues to be plagued by the endemic problems of the production, trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances. This modern day scourge continues to pose serious problems which threaten to destroy the social and moral fabric of our communities. My Government is fully committed to the ongoing process of cooperation with other countries to counter these illegal activities. In this regard, I wish to reiterate in this forum our complete support for the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM), developed by the member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS) to monitor countries' cooperation in the international fight against the drug trade. I also take this opportunity to urge that more resources be allocated through collaborative efforts by the international community to encourage farmers to keep away from the production of illicit crops. In his address to the Millennium Summit, the Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) spoke of the outstanding and invaluable record of good governance and respect for human rights and democracy in the entire Caribbean region. These are aspects of our society of which we are eternally proud. Recently in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, our constitutional democracy was put to the test through open expressions of dissent, but withstood the ordeal through dialogue and compromise. My Government is pleased to put on record its appreciation to the Vincentian people for upholding democratic values and respecting the supremacy of the constitution and the rule of law as fundamental principles by which our beloved country exists and governs itself. I also wish to express gratitude to CARICOM, to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), to the churches, to the National Youth Council, to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to the Employers' Federation and to many individuals and other institutions for their invaluable contributions in bringing about a swift resolution of the matter. My Government has long recognized the urgent need for constitutional reform and will continue to work with other interested parties to bring about meaningful change that would seek, among other things, to strengthen the foundations of our democracy. As full members of this body, we have seen, at close quarters, the importance of constitutional reform in the promotion of democracy, stability and economic development. We also recognize that constitutional reform is crucial to strengthening our own integration processes within the Caribbean Community, including the establishment of a Caribbean court of justice, to be, inter alia, the authoritative body adjudicating on matters pertaining to the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which established CARICOM. Many matters of profound importance to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean Community as a whole are included in the agenda of this fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. These include: sustainable development, the future of United Nations reform, the International Criminal Court and human rights, the death penalty and financing for development. I wish, once again, to focus the attention of this noble gathering to the issue of the Caribbean banana trade with the European Union (EU). The facts are well documented. Banana exports to the European Union from my country and similarly from Dominica, Saint Lucia and other African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are crucial to the economies of these countries and represent over half of all export earnings in some cases. The industry provides substantial employment for many families in Dominica, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my own country. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is appreciative of the efforts of the European Commission and other parties which seek to bring about an amicable and equitable solution to the dispute. However we are deeply concerned that, should the tariff quota regime be eliminated as a means of ensuring conformity with the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling, this would have immeasurable harmful consequences for our economy. It will lead to the destruction of the Caribbean banana industry and negatively affect other ACP supplying States where exports are also crucial to the economy. The two alternative solutions being proposed by the European Commission, that is a first come, first served system, along with a tariff rate quota and, if that proves impracticable, moving directly to a tariff only system, would prove to be disadvantageous and 32  disastrous for the Caribbean industry. Neither system ensures access. We therefore urge the interested parties to the dispute to use their substantial influence to bring about the much-needed breakthrough which will facilitate a resolution that is acceptable to all parties. An efficacious settlement of this long-standing issue will support our efforts, as a small economically vulnerable island State, in eradicating poverty and maintaining peace and economic security, which are vital for the achievement of economic diversification within a reasonable period of transition. While we recognize that there are structural and inherent disadvantages that inhibit our ability to compete with highly integrated operations on the market, we ask that an equitable solution be sought in order to allow our people to engage meaningfully in trade and development, rather than be forever subjected to the aid and dependency syndrome. Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry, which served us well, in no way reflects any misunderstanding of the realities of the present day trade and economic environment. My delegation also wishes to express its concern over the procedural obstacles raised in Geneva within the WTO that would prevent consideration of the waiver requested in respect of the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement if it includes bananas without advice on how the regime will be formed. My country and other members of the Caribbean Community have been actively engaged in diversifying our economies throughout the last quarter of the last century. This has involved activities in the agricultural, manufacturing, tourism and service sectors. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, as a direct corollary of this thrust, we have improved air access to our country and my Government continues to prioritize the education of our people to prepare them for the opportunities that will accrue. My Government will continue to honour its commitments to all international agreements to which it is signatory. In furtherance to our international obligation we have signed the following: the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents. All of these instruments were deposited with the Secretary General during the Millennium Summit. During his speech at the Millennium Summit, Prime Minister Mitchell stated that: “Small island States such as our own, with an enviable record of good governance and human rights, have seen the mighty in the banana trade using the international rules — crafted by them — impede our economic growth.” Similarly, the verdicts that have been imposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on our financial services, without any deference to our rights to be heard, demonstrate total disregard for the well-being of small vulnerable States attempting to diversify their economies. I echo Prime Minister Mitchell's sentiment, “Where is the fairness in free trade?” Offshore financial services is one of our chosen avenues of economic diversification. We believe that we are capable of offering a useful, professional and mutually beneficial service to our clients. Accordingly, in 1995 we embarked on a comprehensive legislative exercise to ensure that we would put in place a regulatory and supervisory framework to adequately administer the conduct of international financial businesses operating in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In our efforts to further strengthen our regulatory regime against money laundering activities, we enacted six additional pieces of offshore legislation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to being a responsible member of the international community, including by playing its part in the war against money laundering. We believe that those who toil to build a better life for themselves, their children, their grandchildren and any other beneficiaries, should be afforded the right of privacy in their affairs. Such people should have access to facilities that will preserve that privacy, and the opportunity should be created for them to optimize and maximize their wealth. It is, however, important to note that whilst we believe in the preservation of privacy, we are also resolute in efforts to ensure that persons of undesirable character and conduct are not allowed to take advantage of the opportunities that are available in our international finance sector. 33  My country and others in the Caribbean Community are deeply concerned that the so-called harmful tax initiative of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is designed to frustrate tax competition, and that it threatens the sovereignty of small island States desperately seeking creative avenues for survival. Such action on the part of the OECD could encourage the creation of a tax cartel, thereby removing the possibility of lower taxes from those who wish to legitimately escape them through the exercise of free choice. It would also close off an area of diversification and economic activity in which poor developing countries can be competitive and which they have actively promoted for a long time. The unilateral practices of the OECD, the Financial Stability Forum and the Financial Action Task Force also impact negatively on the burden of taxation in wealthy countries, impair the competitive capacity of Caribbean jurisprudence in the provision of a global financial service and stifle economic growth in the 47 blacklisted countries, with all the concomitant evils. The small island States of the Caribbean are among those countries most at risk from the adverse effects of climate change. Already, many of our islands are experiencing those effects in areas that impact directly on the important tourism sector of our economies. We are also prone to extremely damaging natural disasters, especially hurricanes and storm surges, which visit us annually with increasing frequency and ferocity. Our diverse region also experiences droughts and floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, with equally devastating effects, if less regularly than the pleasantly named perennials. The continued committed support of the international community is crucial in complementing the work of those States in addressing these serious problems. Our survival as a region is intimately interwoven with our environment. Our physical and economic limitations should not be further burdened by the transshipment of hazardous waste through our waterways. Such actions are a flagrant violation of our human rights and an affront to our sovereign dignity. We therefore reiterate the call for the Caribbean Sea to be a nuclear-free zone in the context of sustainable development. In closing, I take this opportunity to pay tribute in this forum to one who has upheld the highest ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, through service to our country, to the Caribbean and to the international community. I speak of the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and current Chairman of the Caribbean Community, The Right Honourable Sir James F. Mitchell. For 34 years he has served as an elected member of our legislature. He has seen our country through the stages of constitutional development from crown colony to internal selfgovernment, and finally, as our longest serving Prime Minister, to a fully independent State. For us in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it is difficult to contemplate public life without him. His address at the Millennium Summit was his last to this body, for he has decided to demit office as Prime Minister before the twenty-first anniversary of our political independence, on 27 October 2000. Sir James Mitchell has made us all proud by his long, dedicated and visionary service. The initiatives taken by him in the area of land reform, which empowered people through land ownership, are exemplary. I think it is appropriate that, on behalf of Vincentians everywhere, I extend sincere gratitude to him from this rostrum. The challenge is ours: to turn our words into action and to agree on a common vision of our future.          \n",
       "2  I convey to the President the warmest felicitations of Sri Lanka on his election to the high office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, and I pledge to him Sri Lanka's fullest cooperation and support in his work. To the Foreign Minister of Namibia, Mr. Theo- Ben Gurirab, I convey Sri Lanka's appreciation and admiration for the masterly manner in which he served as President of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations. The Millennium Summit is over. I fervently hope that its dreams and hopes for a better world will never fade from the hearts and minds of all mankind. The President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, unable to attend the Summit, conveyed, 24  through a message I had the honour to read out to the Summit, her hopes and her vision for the future of humanity. Her words were these: “Peace among all States and peace among all peoples within States so that all, and not only some, may in safety, without fear, in dignity, without humiliation, in good health, and in material and spiritual well-being enjoy the wonders of life on this miracle we call the planet Earth.” (A/55/PV.7) Therefore, the President of Sri Lanka spoke, with emphasis, of the necessity of protecting and preserving, for the future, those minimal and most fundamental certainties that the Member States of the United Nations have been able to establish — in particular, to preserve what was and continues to be the Organization's very foundation: the entity we know as the State. She pointed out that it was in the General Assembly that representatives of Governments, of peoples and of States gather together under a Charter that assures States of their sovereign equality, their political independence and their territorial integrity. These are the fundamentals of the United Nations system. And this is as it should be. States are the principal organizational entities into which the peoples of this planet have gathered. The principal, overall organizational edifice of the international community is the inter-States system. For the entity we know as the State, there is no substitute. If States weaken, so will this Organization. If States are diminished, so will this Organization be diminished. Thus, it was the plea of the President of Sri Lanka that everything possible be done to protect and preserve, and not to decry or endeavour to erode, the stability and the well-being of the entity we know as the State, for whose sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence the Charter gave us its assurance. Before proceeding any further I should make it clear — in view of recent statements on the part of speakers of obvious goodwill and intentions, but with whose fundamental premises I fundamentally differ — that those who assert the necessity of continued reaffirmation of the sovereignty of the State in terms of the Charter must not be regarded — I repeat, must not be regarded — as having in any way diminished their commitment to the importance of universal adherence to human rights and all that is required for the dignity of the individual. Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its own people and of all peoples everywhere. There is, however, a substantial body of opinion, within which Sri Lanka includes itself, which is of the view that the way to proceed in the matter of human rights and the dignity of the individual is properly through continued and close cooperation between all States, while respecting the sovereignty of each. The way of multilateralism or globalization, which appear expressly or by implication to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States, is not, to many of us in this Hall, a commendable course. It is not a course whose worthiness in practice has as yet been established. Indeed, most endeavours to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States have often had disastrous consequences. With that initial clarification and a reminder that human rights are for the observance not only of States, but non-State entities as well, I shall proceed with the remainder of my address. We must bear in mind that the entities we know as States are national and international corporate entities of enormous complexity, differing in so many respects from corporate entities of the private sector and, of course, differing as well from those innumerable entities, in their thousands now, to which we refer, broadly and benignly, but somewhat simplistically, as civil society. If the management of a developed State with more than adequate resources at its command is a complex undertaking, how much more complex would be the management of a developing State without such resources and such infrastructures? Then there are those developing States such as Sri Lanka, with their multi-ethnic, multireligious societies where the legacies of centuries of a colonial past take more than one generation to erase. Aside from the pressures inherent in the very nature and history of a State, let us not forget the additional external pressures a State is subject to — economic, social and political, legitimate and illegitimate, civil and uncivil, and often criminal — that the age of information and its consequences have brought in their wake. These are external pressures that raise troubling uncertainties for many States and for 25  developing States in particular, that are without the blessings of abundant resources and advanced infrastructures. These are uncertainties that strain the structures of States and could come close to threatening their very existence. Where the processes of globalization are exploited to their advantage by the irresponsible or the illegitimate or the criminal, one is reminded of the report from the Secretariat received by this Assembly three years ago which drew attention to the threat to Government authority and civil society, to law and order and to legitimate economic and political institutions posed by transnational networks of crime, narcotics, money laundering and terrorism having access to sophisticated information technologies and weaponry. Of course, where there is the use of internal armed force against a State, as in my country, the complexities within a State compound themselves many times over; and we know that the use of armed force against a State is the greatest threat of all to its preservation and well-being. This is particularly so in democracies, whose very openness makes them most vulnerable; and Sri Lanka is a democracy of long- standing and unwavering commitment to democratic fundamentals. Peace among States, the primary purpose of the Charter, has to a large extent been achieved, if not in fact in every case, at least in general, and in terms of generally observed rules of international law, under and pursuant to Charter provisions that proscribe the use of armed force by one State against another State, except in self-defence or as authorized by the Security Council. Yet when we turn to peace within States, and the use of armed force against a State internally, we see an entirely different, and an often confusing and frustrating, picture. Each armed conflict is unique; each a creature of its own history; the nature of each determined by its own surroundings. There is no simplicity of circumstance, no uniformity in scenario, no easy solution. Internal armed conflicts come in many different forms. The relatively clear-cut format of a United Nations response to inter-State armed conflicts — monitoring a truce and keeping the peace after an agreed cessation of hostilities — seems, for internal armed conflicts, inadequate or inapplicable. The Charter does not prescribe how this Organization should proceed in cases of internal armed conflicts, except for the wise admonition in Article 2, paragraph 7, which says, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.” In view of the varieties, complexities and intricacies of internal armed conflicts, this Organization appears to be without the necessary structure, the knowledge, expertise, experience and resources — and often, it would seem — without the necessary collective will. To suggest that the United Nations should intervene in internal armed conflicts across the board — a suggestion made, on occasion, by persons of obvious goodwill but with little knowledge of local circumstances — is wishful thinking of the most simplistic kind, and incorrect in the extreme. A proposition of such a nature ignores the fundamental premise, indeed the truism, articulated so impressively to the Millennium Summit by the head of State of Algeria, President Bouteflika, in his summation of the deliberations of round table four: that a democracy, offering to all its peoples the fundamental necessities of peaceful, all-inclusive political processes, simply cannot tolerate armed defiance of the democratically expressed will of the populace of a State, which an armed terroristic attack on a democratic State so obviously constitutes. At a more practical level, where would this Organization — woefully under-financed for the fulfilment of its development objectives, which billions around this world expectantly await — obtain the further resources for such far-flung interventions in internal domestic crises. Charter provisions and United Nations practice affirm that a State may act in individual or collective self-defence should there be an armed attack across its frontiers. Yet, against massive internal armed attack, the abilities of most States — or at least the abilities of most developing States — to react with equivalent armed force in self-defence, or in enforcement of the law of the land, or in the maintenance of law and order, are very limited. Traditional police services are inadequate in design, in training, in equipment and in 26  experience. Few States have ready and affordable access to the necessary information or intelligence. Few States are able to maintain military infrastructures effective against heavily armed guerrilla-type onslaughts and the horrors of terror. Such has been the experience of my country. Sri Lanka has for many years had within its territory an armed conflict that has complicated the lives of the entire population of the country. It is a conflict of an extraordinary nature. A very small group of armed fighters and supporters — numbering less than 15,000 persons in total; schooled in and totally devoted to violence; rejecting the processes of peaceful society and participatory governance; achieving, through the practice of systematic terror, national and international notoriety; rebuffing all overtures for settlement of such problems as they may have through dialogue — continues, in defiance of law and order, in rebellion against the State to fight for the establishment of a separate, monolingual, mono-ethnic State in our territory. A democratic State, because of its openness, its laws, traditions and practices and its commitment to tolerance and dissent, is especially vulnerable to the deployment of force against it by any group within its boundaries. An internal armed challenge to any State anywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere. Unless all States, democratic States in particular, agree to come to the aid of a State in such peril, democracy itself will be imperilled everywhere. Democracy will not survive. When the security and integrity of one State is threatened by an armed group within it, surely — especially in these contemporary times, with the cold war far behind us — it behoves all other States to deny that armed group any encouragement, any succour, any safe haven. Today, for the prosecution of terrorist activities in one country, massive funds are raised with impunity in other countries, often through knowing or unknowing front organizations or other entities that now proliferate in many forms and in many countries, and often, sadly, in the guise of charitable groups or groups ostensibly concerned with human rights or ethnic, cultural or social matters. The magnitude of the collection of funds abroad for terrorist purposes, and the extensiveness of the reach of the international networks developed for that purpose, boggle the mind. Their receipts seem to exceed the receipts of many transnational conglomerates — all free of tax. Revenues come, of course, from the customary illegal trade in drugs, arms or other merchandise, including the smuggling of humans. But there also exists a far more abundant and seemingly limitless reservoir of funds — namely, expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad. As the western media has reported over the past few years from time to time, collections from expatriates abroad for the armed group known as the Tamil Tigers, which is battling the Government of Sri Lanka, are staggering in their magnitude: for example, $400,000 a month from one country; $600,000 a month from another; $2.7 million a month from yet another; and large additional funds from expatriates in still other countries. In 1988 an excellent study was published on financial havens, banking secrecy and money laundering, a study by experts in the field, commissioned by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention. In order to implement adequately the provisions of the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, a study of a similar nature by United Nations bodies on the collection of external funds for massive, continuous internal armed rebellion against a State, such as occurs in Sri Lanka, becomes especially necessary when the armed group battling a State is in blatant violation of the human rights and humanitarian norms and standards — including those relating to children and to children in armed conflict — that this Organization so correctly and so diligently espouses as the minimal contemporary requirements in human society. I proposed such a study at the fourth round table of the Millennium Summit, and that proposal was endorsed by our Chairman, President Bouteflika of Algeria, in his summation to the General Assembly of the proceedings of our round table. I urge that the international community give favourable consideration to that proposal. As the years go by, and the armed conflict fuelled by such massive funds from abroad continues within a State, paradoxically, international perceptions seem to blur, not only among those in civil society, who are often uninformed, but even on the part of those in positions of international authority, within and outside 27  this Organization, who should know better. The existence of the internal armed conflict and the resulting casualties are bemoaned, and a cessation of hostilities is urged at any price, in seeming inattention to the fundamental fact that it is the armed internal group that is the aggressor and it is the State that is the victim. Such a blurring of international perceptions in some quarters as to what the crucial facts are, is distressing, and profoundly disappointing, to those, such as we in Sri Lanka, who have struggled hard, and continue to struggle hard, to preserve our democratic way of life and the richness of our multi-ethnic, multireligious culture in the pluralistic tolerance we were once so blessed to enjoy. I hope that the thoughts that I have expressed today on the nature of the affairs of States, and of the affairs of developing States in the main, will show in some measure why a sympathetic, rather than an inquisitorial, style is by far preferable in relation to the affairs of States, as in all human relationships. At a more general level, I would like, before I move on from this part of my statement, to refer to two other relevant questions: the role of the General Assembly and the role of civil society in the affairs of the United Nations. The General Assembly is the only principal organ of the United Nations in which all Member States are represented, and the only principal organ whose terms of reference allow for consideration of any matter within the scope of the Charter. Yet there is the perception among some that the centre of gravity in decision-making on questions of major policy importance to the Organization appears to have moved away from the General Assembly to an extent unknown in earlier years. Sri Lanka greatly welcomes, therefore, the reaffirmation in paragraph 30 of the Millennium Declaration of the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy- making and representative organ of the United Nations, and the commitment of all nations to enable the General Assembly to play that role effectively. The practical manner in which the General Assembly could play that role will, of course, require very careful thought. The ways in which “civil society”, and the innumerable entities that that expression encompasses, could best contribute to the work of the United Nations — in terms of data collection, research and analysis and expertise — in a manner that does not prejudice the role of States in the affairs of the United Nations, will also require most careful examination. Such contributions should be made in a manner that is not partial or partisan, in favour of or against, but, rather, in a manner that befits an objective and neutral consultant. Moreover, although civil society within a national context could be, and is, well accommodated in domestic political processes, the manner in which civil society could be internationally accommodated within United Nations processes still remains a puzzle. As in all human relationships, so also amongst States: the strong do better than the weak, the rich better than the poor, the developed better than the developing. This is the case most of all when times are hard. The marked decline in official development assistance, and the failure of most of the strong, the rich and the developed to meet their official development assistance pledges, show that for States, there is no general safety net. If there is one message from the Millennium Summit, and one that is now coming from this Millennium Assembly loud and clear, it is that globalization may be a reality for all, but that it is that no panacea for all — certainly not for the developing world. The benefits of globalization have by-passed much of the developing world. The poorest among us, spanning the continents of Africa, Central America and Asia, have experienced increasing marginalization. There is little opportunity for developing countries to be formative in the shaping of the world economy for the future — in the deliberations that really matter. Thus, although we are leaving the past century and the past millennium behind us, and celebrate their passing, more than half of humanity is still haunted by the old, intractable economic and social tragedies that have been with us since the dawn of time: poverty, illiteracy, ill health, hunger, unemployment, the problems of the young, uncontrolled urbanization and the growth of mega-cities. Among these, poverty alleviation and poverty elimination remain for most of us in the developing world the highest and, in fact, the only, meaningful priority. Poverty degrades humanity and, in an era of abundance and conspicuous consumption, visible in real time across billions of television screens throughout the world, undermines the very foundations 28  necessary for the growth of humane societies and refined governance. The developing world needs to be accorded an adequate formative voice in the formulation of a new development chapter for the twenty-first century. Thus we turn to the United Nations and, in ultimate recourse, as it were, to this General Assembly, under whose active supervisory authority there must be a revival of a comprehensive North-South development dialogue — a dialogue that seems to be fading away. To tell the countless starving and helpless millions that a free global marketplace will show us the way is, I am sorry to say, simply not enough. Resource deprivation over many generations and its debilitating consequences on adequate infrastructural growth has severely damaged the capacity of developing countries to cope with the modern world. A new development chapter must provide for the catastrophic negative contingencies, be they “man- made” or otherwise, including such occurrences as the present surge in the price of oil to the highest levels in a decade that now place crushing burdens on the national economies of developing countries struggling desperately to contend with economic realities. They, like Sri Lanka, can only hope and pray that the oil- producing countries, which are certainly not insensitive to the plight of the developing world, will find it possible in some way to relieve such pressures in the very near future. I should also wish at this juncture in my address to say a word about the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) of the seven States of South Asia — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — a body which is deeply committed to the advancement of the economic and social well-being of our peoples, numbering now in the region of 1.25 billion, not merely through national endeavour, but through regional and international cooperation. Sri Lanka, as the current Chair of SAARC, is seeking to implement the programme of activities laid down at the 1991 Colombo summit as best it can in difficult circumstances. The people of our region are deeply committed to the goals of SAARC. They continue to interact vigorously on a wide range of professional, cultural, educational and social activities, notwithstanding the temporary setback to high-level political involvement that SAARC has suffered at this time. We in SAARC are confident that it will not be long before our movement is again able to play its full role in the welfare of our peoples. I have just returned to New York from the International Conference on War-Affected Children, organized so successfully by the Government of Canada and held at Winnipeg. I cannot conclude my address to the General Assembly this year without making at least a brief reference to the abominable crimes that are being committed against young Tamil children in Sri Lanka by the rebel group known as the Tamil Tigers. They have been, and are, forcibly conscripting even 10-year- old children, boys and girls, for battle against the Sri Lankan Army. Some of these children have been programmed into suicide bombers. They are forced to wear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on them to evade capture. This wretched practice continues unabated. In 1998, at the invitation of my Government, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, visited Sri Lanka and met some of the Tamil Tiger leaders. They assured him that they would not recruit any person under the age of 17 and would not send into battle any person below the age of 18. A few months ago he stated that since his visit to Sri Lanka there have been continuous reports of the recruitment and the use of children by the Tamil Tigers. The assurance they gave him has been totally dishonoured. In a poignant answer to a question by an interviewer, the Special Representative said this: “Children who become soldiers lose their innocence. Part of the reason why the fighting groups will tend to reach out to children is because, of course, the adults may become disillusioned, they may be killed off, they may run away, so they reach the children who are less able to defend themselves. But there's a more cynical reason than that: children, because they are innocent, can be moulded into the most unquestioning, ruthless tools of warfare, into suicide commandos, into committing the worst atrocities. In other situations, it is ideology — come fight for the homeland, come fight for our ethnic group, come fight for a new society — that may appeal to families and to children. So there 29  are many reasons which facilitate the abuse of children in this way.” I thank the Special Representative for having had the courage to speak out on this important issue. To remain silent in the face of such criminality is to encourage and condone it. It is the duty of all of us who care about the children of the world to rally against the cruelty, brutality and the grievous harm cynically inflicted on them by groups such as the one that abuses them in Sri Lanka. A few months ago, the representative of the United Nations Children's Fund in Sri Lanka told journalists — and I thank him for his statement — that the situation of children in the areas held by the Tamil Tigers had worsened since they gave their assurance to the United Nations Special Representative. Parents have reported that their children have been recruited. It is a serious problem. He observed that until they, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), announce to their own people that they have taken measures to prevent children below 17 years from being recruited, we cannot take their promises seriously. A respected and courageous human rights group in Sri Lanka, consisting mostly of Tamil teachers who used to teach at Jaffna University, have said in a recent report that since last May a fresh child-recruitment campaign has been launched by the Tamil Tigers. According to their report, children as young as 10 years are being forcibly conscripted, age being no consideration as long as the child was able to carry a gun. In recent days and months the international press has focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in Sri Lanka. A few days ago Sri Lanka deposited its instrument of ratification of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Protocol has noted that the Statute of the International Criminal Court makes conscripting, enlisting or using children in combat a war crime in both international and non- international armed conflicts. It holds non-State actors also accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State parties to cooperate in preventing and combating such crimes. Accordingly, today, in this General Assembly of the United Nations Sri Lanka calls upon all States to ratify this Protocol, and it calls upon the State parties on whose territory the LTTE has offices and front organizations to take strong punitive action against such establishments, and to declare the LTTE a criminal organization, as the LTTE sustains its criminal activity in respect of the use of child soldiers through funds generated on the territories of other State parties, which are obliged to cooperate in terms of the Convention and the Protocol. The Winnipeg Conference ended yesterday with an impassioned plea to the world to move urgently from words to deeds, to save the hundreds of thousands of children who are abused, maimed, displaced, traumatized and killed by war. In our cruel world if anything should stir the conscience of mankind it is surely the plight of these children. Let it not be said that yet again we have failed — failed to hear and heed the anguished cry of children in distress, children on whom adults have inflicted, and continue to inflict, unspeakable cruelty. No, politics cannot divide us on the issue of child soldiers. Massive funds are not required to save them. What is required is the will and the commitment to act of those States which are in a position to act. The Winnipeg appeal is addressed to them. Let us all wholeheartedly support that appeal now so that when the special session of the General Assembly for Follow-up to the World Summit for Children is held here in New York next September, we will be able to adopt practical measures that will finally ensure that children will be forever protected from the ravages of war.               \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Allow me, Sir, at the outset to congratulate you heartily on your election to the Presidency of this General Assembly. Finland is a close friend and partner within the Nordic community. We wish you success with this challenging task and pledge to you the full support of the Icelandic delegation. The Millennium Declaration provides the commitments of the world community in the new century. To prevent conflicts, maintain international peace and security and make peace an achievable goal at the end of armed conflicts, we need to continue strengthening the United Nations and the international legal system as a whole. Iceland has always supported verifiable arms control and arms reduction measures and will continue to support realistic disarmament proposals aiming at maximum security with a minimum of weapons. It is appalling to note the enormous sums being spent on weapons, while the money could be used to significantly improve the lives of millions. Today, when there is an obvious need to assess the United Nations ability to conduct peacekeeping operations, it has proved extremely important to have a Secretary-General who has such a deep knowledge of the matter through his own experience. I would like to commend the Secretary-General for taking the initiative to ask a panel of prominent experts in the field to assess the situation. I welcome the Brahimi report. Its recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. Even though my country does not have a military, it has been able to participate in peacekeeping operations. It has done so in the Balkans by providing medical staff, policemen and experts in the fields of law, the media and women's rights. We have noted with interest the recommendations made in the Brahimi report concerning the non-military aspects of peace operations. We will be studying them carefully now that we are in the process of looking into how we can strengthen our contribution to peacekeeping in the future. The report states that expressions of general support in the form of statements and resolutions must be followed up with tangible actions. We will be taking these words of wisdom seriously in our policy-making. In the preparations for the Millennium Assembly, the Secretary-General encouraged Member States to engage more effectively in the international legal framework by acceding to a number of legal instruments. One to which Iceland has decided to accede is the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. The Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Unfortunately, it has not succeeded in reflecting the tremendous changes in the international arena which have taken place since its establishment. In order to ensure its credibility in years to come, the reform process has to be accelerated. The rules of international law governing the relations between States are now well established; this also applies in the fields of human rights and humanitarian law. These rules set out the rights and obligations of States and individuals. But ground rules do not suffice if it is not possible to enforce them. There are mechanisms to ensure respect and compliance with these rules, such as the General Assembly, the Security Council and peacekeeping missions. As a complement to these mechanisms, an effective international court system should be available to bring those who breach these rules to justice, at the same time serving to deter potential perpetrators. With this in mind, I believe that the greatest achievements towards strengthening the international legal system in recent years have been the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Iceland has ratified the Rome Statute and encourages all other States to do so. I welcome the proposal to include cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. I had the honour of chairing the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe last year. I am therefore well aware of the important contribution made by the Council to peace and stability in Europe, especially in the field of human rights. The United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Council of Europe and other organizations 14  responded to the serious situation in the Balkans by joining forces and working together to make reconstruction achievable. In Kosovo, the politically motivated and inter- ethnic violence must be stopped. Rogue elements cannot be allowed to destroy possibilities created by the international community. One ethnic group must not be allowed to win at the expense of another. The Kosovars have been provided with a unique opportunity to build a just community in the region — a community where the fundamental freedoms and rights of every individual and minority group are respected. Only by utilizing this opportunity are Kosovars going to be able to build a stable foundation for lasting peace and stability for future generations. The same can be said about similar situations elsewhere in the Balkans, such as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international community has taken on an enormous task in building a whole new civic structure within Kosovo. The development of a legal system and free media have been two challenging tasks. The elections to take place in October are also going to be challenging. Hopefully, they can be carried out in an orderly and peaceful manner. It is very important to include women in the political process. In this respect, I would like to commend the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for the good work carried out in Kosovo, not only in the political field but also in fighting violence against women and in promoting women's participation in economic activities. The importance of human rights in securing long- term stability and security, both within and between countries, cannot be overestimated. It is therefore essential that no compromises be accepted in this field, and our aims should remain high. The Security Council should be commended for discussing the grave humanitarian crisis and security threat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and also for discussing the issue of children and armed conflict. The discussion in the Council has served to concentrate the attention of the international community on these issues and led the way for others to take the measures required. Both issues affect children in a very serious manner. I expect them to feature prominently on the agenda of next year's special session to follow up the World Summit for Children. I also welcome the decision to hold a special session of the General Assembly on the enormous problem of HIV/AIDS and international efforts to combat it. The rights of women were significantly enhanced with the adoption last year of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Iceland has signed the Protocol and is preparing its ratification. I cannot fail to condemn the terrible plight of those women around the world who are still enduring major human rights abuses, including female genital mutilation and trafficking, as well as severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the right to work. During the Millennium Summit, the Prime Minister of Iceland signed the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Iceland welcomes their adoption and hopes that they will further secure the human rights of children. We have to put extra effort into working towards the elimination of racial discrimination. It is worrying to note the trend towards increasing racism and xenophobia in certain parts of the world, including Europe. This needs to be fought at all levels. The World Conference to be held in South Africa next year will without doubt play an important role. Iceland welcomes this Conference and feels that, in the light of history, South Africa is a very appropriate venue for it. As reflected in the report of the Secretary- General, “We the peoples”, fighting poverty remains one of the main challenges to the United Nations. People living in poverty do not have the opportunity to exercise many of their fundamental rights and freedoms. They cannot benefit from the possibilities of globalization. We need to reverse the current trend, as decided at the Millennium Summit. But more needs to be done. Globalization and new technologies offer many opportunities to reduce poverty at a faster rate than in the past. We have been strengthening our development cooperation, both bilaterally and multilaterally. At the bilateral level, we have concentrated on a group of African countries with a focus on strengthening their fishing industry and education and health areas, with the potential to positively alter the lives of people in need. On the multilateral level, we will be contributing to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative 15  through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Most of our decisions are based on compromises, in which each and every one of us has to give a little in order to reach an agreement. It is very important to keep this in mind, not only when we discuss substance, but also when the time comes for us to pay our dues, both to the regular budget and to the peacekeeping budget. It is crucial for the good functioning of this Organization that all Members pay their contributions fully, on time and without any conditions. In recent years, the oceans of the world have received increased attention in the General Assembly. We welcome this development. Iceland's economy is based on the sustainable harvest of living marine resources. The health and responsible stewardship of the oceans are therefore of critical importance to us. Last year, we resolved to improve United Nations coordination in the area of ocean affairs. Towards that end, we established an Informal Consultative Process to discuss the Secretary-General's report on the oceans and the law of the sea. I was pleased with the implementation of this decision of the first Meeting of this Process last spring. However, we must act carefully when seeking to improve our coordination and cooperation in this area. Ocean issues must be addressed at the appropriate level and be consistent with the rights and obligations laid down in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must fully respect the sovereign right of States over their natural resources and the competence of existing international organizations. Above all, the integrity of the Convention must be preserved. We must be mindful that the Convention provides the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. The United Nations specialized agencies have an important role to play in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans. A key area in this respect is marine scientific research. We need more accurate and policy-oriented information on the state of the oceans. Coordination towards that end would be a worthy task for the new Informal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs. At the onset of a new millennium, it is more pressing than ever before to ensure the access of people in the developing countries, especially in rural areas, to readily available and sustainable energy. Today, about one third of the world's population does not have such access, and this situation is obviously a serious obstacle to the development of these communities. In my country, we have been able to bring sustainable energy to all households in the country. We are sharing our experience and knowledge with the developing countries through the United Nations University Geothermal Training Programme, which is located in Iceland and funded by my Government. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio created a momentum for building a secure future for humankind and life on Earth under the banner of sustainable development. Soon, world leaders will meet again at a global conference to take stock of the progress made in meeting these challenges, laid down in Agenda 21 and the other Rio agreements. It is indeed true that we have not been able to live up to all the expectations raised in Rio, but we should not fail to acknowledge the progress that we have made. The concept of sustainable development has truly become accepted as a fundamental guiding strategy in environmental and socio-economic affairs. In my own country, which is dependent on fisheries, we believe that we are reaping the benefits of the sustainable-use regime for our fish stocks in the form of a healthy ecosystem and a robust economy. Regional and international efforts to prevent the pollution of the oceans have continued to gather strength and we can expect further efforts, in particular to control pollution from land-based sources. It is my belief that, in charting a course for the future, we should be looking at success stories and learning from them, rather than concentrating on the obstacles we face. Let us be guided by the doers, but not the doom-sayers.  \n",

It took intellect and diplomatic savoir-faire to state a complex case in such a concise and forceful way. We are grateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for producing it. “We, the peoples” are of course the opening words of the Charter, and I want to take them as a point of departure. Other speakers have done so before me and have argued in favour of a more robust structure for keeping the peace in the world community. They are right. The United Nations role in the area of preventing or limiting armed conflict was conceived as its principal purpose. The Brahimi report has shown how, in spite of that, the United Nations peacekeeping function has in fact become its Achilles heel. The Brahimi recommendations deserve to be implemented — the sooner the better. At present, the Netherlands Government and parliament are debating how to improve our national contribution to peacekeeping. 15  “We, the Peoples” can lead to reflections on a totally different side of the United Nations reality as well. I, for one, would take this opportunity to argue in favour of closer ties between the United Nations and the private sector. In 1945 the world was run by States. The Charter hinges on that very assumption. It covers all aspects of life as they were prevalent at the time, from peace and security to social justice, from economic cooperation to human rights. Despite its ambition, the Charter hardly mentions any other actors besides States. Non- governmental organizations appear in the Charter only once. The private sector is not referred to at all. In other words, the Charter conforms to a model of governance as old as the Peace of Westphalia, a state system going back to the mid-1600s. In order to strategize for the future, we need to ask ourselves: who, in actual fact, runs the world today; where and how are world affairs conducted; and how can we position the United Nations accordingly? The United Nations is made up of Member States. That is fitting and proper. States will be the custodians of foreign relations for a long time to come. But their roles have changed significantly with time. States can no longer be thought of as the hard billiard balls of international relations. Internationalization has altered the concept of sovereignty. Nor are Sates autonomous entities as before, pursuing self-defined national interests. Their actions are now much more shaped by economic pressures, information flows, and population movements. For States, too, globalization is here to stay. Other actors have entered both the domestic and international scenes. Civil society is one. The private sector is another. Since 1945, civil society, made up of non-profit organizations, has blossomed along a wide spectrum, beyond any expectation of the United Nations founding fathers. Many non-governmental organizations operate across national boundaries. At the present time, the United Nations system could never hope to operate properly without the assistance of non-governmental organizations, not to mention normative thinking and advocacy. Non-governmental organizations have acquired access to the United Nations at different levels, and participate in many of its discussions. Although a potent actor on the domestic and international levels, the private sector has been virtually ignored by traditional United Nations diplomacy. The business community, and notably transnational corporations, were viewed by many as the competitor, if not as the enemy of international public interest. Documents critical of multinationals were being issued by the United Nations and the specialized agencies until recently. Confrontation rather than dialogue. I am not contending that there were no grounds for that position: quite the contrary. However, nowadays we see a growing awareness in the business community of the necessity of responsible corporate policies and of a role for private enterprise in the pursuit of interests that go beyond maximizing immediate profits. As an example, I refer to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, in which the pharmaceutical industry closely cooperates with international organizations, Governments and other actors. We need to build on that. Indeed, the time has come to expand the concept of a partnership with the private sector. Why? Two reasons. First of all, the world is up against incredible odds and, secondly, the private sector does exist and wields a lot of power in the international arena. About the odds: take a sustainable future, where elementary laws of ecology must be respected. Not even the most powerful Government can put a stop to global warming — nor all the Member States of the United Nations combined. A sustainable future needs to be pursued in conjunction with industry, civil society and the scientific community. For equitable working conditions, and other forms of social justice, States need to involve the private sector. The same is true for fighting corruption, the spread of small arms, wasting water or AIDS. We have truly entered an era that is very different from the one in which the United Nations was born — an era in which the course of humanity and the quality of life on earth have more and more become a shared responsibility; an era where Governments, the private sector and civil society are drawn ever more closely together. They all have a stake in global governance. The so-called global public goods are a matter for all of them together. The private sector has a stake in the future of the planet, too. Of course, it is here to do business. But no planet, no profit. Companies should find it in their own interest to assume a responsibility equal to their weight in international relations and the influence they have at 16  the domestic level. Chief executive officers, too, want a livable world for their grandchildren. The private sector must be called upon to enter into a responsible corporate partnership in sync with other actors at the international plane. True, the role of each actor needs to be different. Their motivation can remain different, too — as does the legal basis on which they act. But their determination needs to be the same: the determination to secure the longevity of life as we know it and to secure for everyone on the planet an equitable share of its bounty. Different roles, shared responsibility. That concept needs to take root in this Organization as well. The United Nations cannot credibly hope to play a galvanizing role in meeting the challenges of the coming century if it cannot show that its debates and its action platforms reflect the real world outside the conference rooms. If we want to see the United Nations as “unique in world affairs” — as the Millennium report puts it — it must be able to show that all players are on the stage. The Secretary-General's Global Compact could not have come at a more opportune moment. It is the mere beginning of a process, but it is off to a promising start. The Global Compact deserves the active support of the international community, and it deserves to be joined by other multinationals. I do understand the trepidations of some non-governmental organizations who fear that multinational corporations will drape themselves in the United Nations flag and become untouchable in the pursuit of profit. I understand, too, the apprehension felt by diplomats in this hall, who have a lifetime invested in the exclusivity of the State and its monopoly on multilateral discourse. But the Global Compact is not a Trojan horse. And I will go even further. We have given civil society structural access to the United Nations system. By contrast, the access we are giving to the private sector, with the notable exception of the International Labour Organization, has been ad hoc, not structural. In the future, we must create appropriate channels of communication with the private sector, inside this Organization, where they, as well as Governments and civil society, can try and get a hold on the convulsions of our time — a forum where, at the very least, they can deliberate and begin to break down the barriers of mistrust that have divided them for so long. That is the first reason why the United Nations needs to broaden its scope and become more inclusive. The second is the power of the private sector. Many companies have turnovers larger than the national budgets of some Member States, and the same is true for the personal fortunes of some chief executive officers. The relationship between States and the private sector has altered dramatically over time. States were once thought of as bulwarks against harmful economic impact from abroad. Economic weight was viewed as a trump card in the power play among nations. Today, States are increasingly serving as instruments for adjusting domestic policy to the realities of the present-day world economy. They have become intermediaries between the world economy, with its own structure of power, and domestic societies. This brings up the question of where world affairs are being conducted and how they have caused a shift in the style of diplomacy. Economic globalization has shifted the focus of attention to forums other than the United Nations here in New York, notably to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and, on a regional level, the European Union. Policies are tested in the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos or decided elsewhere. Brussels has become a hub of world affairs. That focus has brought on a different cast of players than in the days of Talleyrand and Metternich. Foreign Ministers now work shoulder to shoulder not only with development ministers, but also with finance and trade ministers, as well as with central bankers. International affairs, whether we like it or not, are increasingly about economics. Forging a relationship with the private sector is therefore indispensable if the United Nations wants to preserve its relevance over the long haul. The multilateral system, for its part, must seek closer ties with other centres of power and with the business community. Mr. Kofi Annan has been vigorously pursuing closer relations with all these various forums, and we encourage him to do more of the same. Responsible corporate partnership is also about protecting the weak. The United Nations was set up not only to guarantee peace and security, but also to secure freedom from want. Despite its obvious advantages, globalization is leaving too many victims by the wayside. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and the poor suffer the most, in war and in peace. Meanwhile, the private sector wields 17  a great deal of power in its decisions as to where it will buy, sell and invest. Those decisions may bear directly on the quality of life in many developing countries. Even though the odds are staggering, the United Nations system can make a difference in reducing poverty, gender inequality and child and maternal mortality. But it can make a difference only from a position of strength and from a platform shared by other actors at the international level: from a position of shared responsibility. The Millennium Summit has declared poverty eradication the United Nations number one priority. We applaud that. But fighting poverty is not only a moral imperative, as it always has been; it has also become an economic one. That is another reason for the United Nations to become more inclusive of the private sector. The Secretary-General's report (A/54/2000), “We the peoples”, duly poses the question of how to take the United Nations forward. Whatever the way forward, it needs to be a bold one. For too long we have been remoulding old ideas. While doing so, we have kept the United Nations on a very short leash, hardly allowing it to stray off the beaten path. More of the same is not enough. In other words, the United Nations is bound to miss its cue if we, the peoples, pursue our business as usual. The future will pass us by. The alternative is an avenue that is much more ambitious. It amounts to using the United Nations system as a vehicle for the development of a new vision of world politics, a vision for the “post- Westphalian” era. In such a vision, present trends would be given legitimacy and a conceptual framework. In such a vision, the principle of non- intervention yields to the defence of human rights; sovereignty is further reappraised; there is room for civil society and the private sector; and economics are also held responsible for social and development goals. Such is the road less travelled, but the only one that can make all the difference.  "
