I'm a teacher and I work online every day. What do you do? I like playing golf and tennis in my free time. How about you? At the moment, I'm working on my website. What are you doing right now? I'm tired today because I got up early. I usually get up at six o'clock. When do you usually get up? I think it's great you're learning English. How often do you study English? Did you study English yesterday? How about tomorrow? Are you going to study English tomorrow? OK, I know that studying English isn't the most important thing in the world! What else are you going to do this week? I'm going to attend a concert on Saturday. Do you have any special plans? Last weekend, I went to visit my friends in San Francisco. What did you do? How often do you do that? When is the next time you are going to do that? Thank you for talking to me. Have a nice day! There is also an ​audio file of this conversation.\")\n",
